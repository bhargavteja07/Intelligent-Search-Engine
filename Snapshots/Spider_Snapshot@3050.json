The speed with which individual computer processors have grown faster and more efficient has slowed down in recent years due to physical limitations. To get around this apparent speed limit, hardware designers have resorted to designing computer chips that contain multiple independent processors, also known as cores. The resulting machine is known as a multi-core computer. This work-around is limited by the need to coordinate activities between processors, currently done using what\u2019s called a lock. When a program uses multiple cores concurrently, there are times when a critical piece of information or data needs to be modified before the next step in computing can take place. To prevent multiple chips from accessing that shared resource simultaneously \u2013 which could lead to errors \u2013 the data is temporarily \u201clocked,\u201d meaning that only one core can handle and modify it at a time. But locking can be slow. The chip must first \u201cacquire\u201d the lock, or send signals to all the other chips that the data it needs to modify is off-limits; then it does what it needs to do with that data, before finally releasing the lock, making it available to other processors in the computer. \u201cThis method of locking shared data is known as synchronized access, which can be highly inefficient,\u201d said Jakob Eriksson, associate professor of computer science in the UIC College of Engineering and principal investigator on the grant. Eriksson and his students will refine an alternative approach to handling shared data resources on multi-core computers. \u201cInstead of synchronization or locking, we are looking at another way of computing called delegation,\u201d Eriksson said. In delegation, a single core acts as a server whose sole job it is to deal with data that needs to be shared among processors. While delegation often comes with a higher initial cost in terms of time needed, ultimately, performance can be much faster than with locking on modern computers. \u201cConsider the analogy of a family doing dishes,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cThe locking approach is inefficient: each family member opens the tap, squirts some soap, washes one dish, closes the tap, dries their hands and then waits for their turn to use the sink again. With the delegation approach, the family members hand their dishes to a single designated washer who uses a pre-filled sink of soapy water and quickly does the dishes for everybody. For a single shared resource \u2013 in this analogy that\u2019s the sink \u2013 with many users contending for it, delegation is always more efficient.\u201d In previous research, Eriksson\u2019s group showed that an efficient delegation system can dramatically outperform locking-based methods on processes that need shared access to individual items of data. They found that delegation is 10 times faster than using a lock-based processing system. Under the new grant, Eriksson will continue to refine delegation-based processing by identifying and eliminating roadblocks to additional gains in processing speed, and by adapting delegation to work in a wider range of settings. \u00a0 \n\nContact\n\nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nFeatured Academic Research, Research \n \nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n Categories \nFeatured Academic Research, Research  Topics computer, computer science, processing Sharon Parmet | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/07/kaitlyn-baker-422999-unsplash.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-acadresearch", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer-science", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/processing", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDecember 6, 2018\t\t\t Chicago, a city known worldwide for its planning and design, will have its first-ever graduate degree in city design when the University of Illinois at Chicago launches a new program next fall. The master of city design degree, based in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will offer an interdisciplinary learning experience that blends elements of architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and other creative fields. Students will experience intensive city-based courses and studios that provide immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice. \u201cThe master of city design expands the portfolio of degree offerings by the college, reflecting the changing needs of cities and metropolitan regions,\u201d said Michael Pagano, dean of the college. \u201cThat the degree is offered in the center of a global city makes it an exceptionally attractive program for professionals who are looking to enhance their skill set.\u201d Serving as director designate for the program is Sanjeev Vidyarthi, whose own training and professional experience combines architecture, urban design and spatial planning. Sanjeev Vidyarthi, UIC associate professor of urban planning and policy and director designate of the master of city design program. \u201cThe master of city design program not only showcases the university\u2019s Great Cities Commitment, but is also well-positioned to produce reflective designers equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills to face the complex challenges of an increasingly urban world,\u201d said Vidyarthi, associate professor of urban planning and policy. The program will prepare students for career opportunities at planning and design consulting firms and related work with governments, foundations, community organizations and public sector agencies. It will also enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design. Graduates of the program will be desirable to prospective employers for their \u201cability to conceive urban public spaces and civic improvement projects by focusing on the physical design aspects of spatial relationships and interactions between people and places,\u201d Vidyarthi said. The program\u2019s courses will be taught by faculty and urban scholars from UIC research centers such as the Great Cities Institute and Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, and accomplished practitioners from Chicago\u2019s leading design firms. The 38-credit-hour degree can be completed in one year of full-time study. Applications are due Feb. 15 for international applicants and March 15 for domestic applicants. To be considered for a limited number of departmental scholarships, applicants should apply by Jan. 15. In addition to the new degree, the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers two bachelor\u2019s degrees in urban studies and public policy, along with master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in urban planning and policy as well as public administration. Certificate programs in geospatial analysis and visualization, and public transit planning and management are also available. More information about the master of city design degree is available online or contact Vidyarthi at svidy@uic.edu or (312) 355-0309. \n\nContact\n\nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n\n\n \nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n Categories \nCampus, Students  Topics cities, College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, degree programs, design, master's degree, spatial planning Brian Flood | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design/col-cuppa-main-lockb-sm-red", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design/sanjeev-vidyarthi-2", "https://today.uic.edu/author/bflood", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/cities", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-urban-planning-and-public-affairs", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/degree-programs", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/design", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/masters-degree", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/spatial-planning", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff": {"text": "\n                Dear Members of the Campus Community: The residential, health care\u00a0and...

The 18-month grant, led by UIC\u2019s Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, will back the development and use of an online tool for regional partners and economic development organizations in the Quad Cities, Rockford, Peoria and Chicago. The grant marks phase two of the State of Illinois Defense Industry Adjustment Program, also known as the Illinois DIA program, a data-driven initiative to assist communities linked to the defense industry adapt to changes in federal military spending. Phase one was launched in 2015 via a two-year, $5.5 million grant from the Department of Defense to the University of Illinois System. \u201cResearch and scholarship in support of Illinois communities is a key component of our institution\u2019s public mission,\u201d said Michael D. Amiridis, UIC Chancellor. \u201cUIC is proud to team with community partners from across the state to provide them with critical information that will help identify areas of advancement or vulnerability, and shape their economic development strategies for the future.\u201d The first phase of the project relied on data collection to identify the full scope of defense assets across the state, as well as industries that are reliant on military spending. The second phase will incorporate new partners to help translate the insights gained from the initial phase into meaningful opportunities for companies and the local organizations and economic development stakeholders that support them. \u201cThis grant enables the Voorhees Center, in partnership with regional economic development organizations in defense-intensive regions in Illinois, to provide relevant insights and information, and to facilitate support and services to defense-connected manufacturers and businesses in the state,\u201d said Yittayih Zelalem, co-director of the UIC Voorhees Center. UIC\u2019s Voorhees Center will lead the development and use of an online tool for regional partners and economic development organizations in the Quad Cities, Rockford, Peoria and Chicago. Phase one partners, the University of Illinois System and Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce, will be joined in phase two by the Chicago Metro Metal Consortium, the Rockford Area Economic Development Council, and the Greater Peoria Economic Development Council. Partners will have access to the Supply Chain Mapping Tool, an online platform created by the Voorhees Center, which will provide users with real-time data for an informed perspective of the federal military\u2019s manufacturing and supply chain in this part of the country, and help quantify the effect of Department of Defense changes, expansions and cutbacks in these regions. \u201cThe Supply Chain Mapping Tool, which is the first of its kind for Illinois manufacturing, will open the door to many possibilities for growth and opportunities for firms and communities in this state to be even more competitive,\u201d said Janet Smith, co-director of the Voorhees Center. The Voorhees Center, which is based in the UIC College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will coordinate and work collaboratively with the partners to outline strategies that address the economic shifts and outcomes experienced in defense-dependent communities. The second phase of the grant will also continue efforts to bolster the Illinois Defense Network, which is managed by the University of Illinois System to engage stakeholders from industry, government, and academia to develop and implement programs that strengthen Illinois\u2019 defense economy and connect communities through the State of Illinois DIA Program. Established earlier this year, the network will share industry best practices and address critical needs, such as assistance with cybersecurity assessments. \n\nContact\n\nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n\n\n \nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n Categories \nResearch  Topics Illinois, manufacturing, military, U.S. Department of Defense, Voorhees Center Brian Flood | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-awarded-2-4m-dod-grant-to-assist-illinois-military-dependent-communities/col-cuppa-npvc-ctt-sm-red-3", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-awarded-2-4m-dod-grant-to-assist-illinois-military-dependent-communities/martin-grincevschi-471981-unsplash", "https://today.uic.edu/author/bflood", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/illinois", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/manufacturing", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/military", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/u-s-department-of-defense", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/voorhees-center", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://economicimpact.uic.edu": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari.

BuiltWorlds 2018 Hackathon. By David Staudacher A team of UIC engineering students won the recent BuiltWorlds 2018 Hackathon, which included a $10,000 prize, at the Salt Flats\u2019 West Loop innovation house. The two-day event kicked off Friday evening as participants heard from industry professionals and fellow hackers who described potential problems teams could tackle throughout the weekend. The UIC team, which went by the name \u201cPoliThinkers,\u201d was made up of electrical and computer engineering students Michele Calvi and Andrea Ciccardi; computer science students Giovanni Agugini Bassi, Iacopo Olivo and Francesco Pinci, and bioengineering alumna Chiara Gatti. The students\u00a0are all part of UIC\u2019s master\u2019s degree contract programs between the College of Engineering and Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico di Milano. They competed against seven other teams of hackers and coders as they worked to create the best solution to some of the BuiltWorld\u2019s problems. \u201cThe hackathon was about innovating the construction world and, speaking with people, we found out that security was one of the most important concerns,\u201d Ciccardi said. \u201cFor this reason, we tried to think about a solution that applied our knowledge to that world and\u00a0the idea of wearable connected devices came out from the brainstorming session.\u201d The UIC team developed an interactive system to prevent accidents by warning workers in dangerous situations and reminding them of safety procedures while using a certain kind of machinery. The system is able to read vitals from people to warn others when an accident occurs in order to speed up emergency operations and eliminate unnecessary steps in the protocol. Even with a solid idea, the team still ran into two big obstacles during the event. \u201cWhen we found out that our idea was similar to one already in the market. We wrote to one of the judges and she suggested to us to focus on what we had that was more than what already existed. She and other people at the event helped us a lot since they were really interested in the idea,\u201d Ciccardi said. \u201cThe second was to develop the real demo for the event. Our solution is a connected wearable device system, but, not having any bracelet with sensors to use, we managed to make everything with an android cellphone. The guys who developed the demo didn\u2019t sleep much that night, but they did a great work to arrive on Sunday afternoon with a working demo to show some of the use cases of our device.\u201d Apart from developing the idea, the team also had to present it to a panel of judges. This is an area where the UIC team set themselves apart from the competition. According to the judges, UIC\u2019s presentation was much more thorough than some of the teams. The team considered stakeholders, reviewed statistics from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and really applied the information to their presentation. \n\nContact\n\nUIC News contributor\n\nuictoday@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nStudents \n \nUIC News contributor\n\nuictoday@uic.edu\n Categories \nStudents  Topics engineering, hackathon UIC News contributor | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ECE_Hackathon-winners-3.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/uicnews-opa", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/engineering", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/hackathon", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://give.uic.edu": {"text": "Have a personalized WEB CODE?

(Photographs: Media Art Services Hannah Kirby and Peter Kirby). Gallery 400 on the University of Illinois at Chicago campus is one of six recipients chosen by the Joyce Foundation to receive a 2019 Joyce Award, which includes a $50,000 grant to help support collaborations between artists of color and cultural organizations. The award was announced Dec. 12 and will go toward commissioning Mexican visual artist Adela Goldbard to stage \u201cThe Last Judgment,\u201d a six-week exhibition at Gallery 400, as well as a traveling, pyrotechnic performance in Chicago\u2019s Little Village neighborhood. According to the Joyce Foundation, the 2019 Joyce Awards were awarded to highlight the six collaborations between artists of color and arts and cultural organizations in Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Goldbard\u2019s work will feature large-scale sculptures and will draw on Little Village residents to script their experiences of environmental justice, migration and safety, while envisioning a collective future for this Latino community. Adela Goldbard (Photograph: Kiam Marcelo Junio) Both the exhibition and the participatory event will be unveiled in fall 2019. \u201cWe could not be happier to have the support and affirmation of the Joyce Award for this project with Adela and Little Village residents,\u201d said Lorelei Stewart, director and chief curator of Gallery 400 at UIC. \u201cNot only will Gallery 400 be able to strengthen our ties between the campus and the neighborhood, but Adela will be able to bring Mexican artisans to work with Chicago builders to construct the work, as well as enlist neighborhood artists and organizers in the co-writing workshops. Ultimately, \u2018The Last Judgment\u2019\u00a0will be a bi-national bridge that reconnects Little Village residents to traditions rooted in and remembered from Mexico but not often practiced here in the U.S.\u201d According to Joyce Foundation officials, the grants are intended to develop works that \u201cengage, educate, and challenge, while celebrating the diversity in their local communities.\u201d The aim of this year\u2019s projects is to take a creative and compelling look at themes of immigration, segregation, community sustainability and find a \u201csense of home in our polarized society.\u201d \u201cFor 15 years, the Joyce Awards have been a celebration of cultural diversity. This year, given the climate in our country, there is a greater need to spotlight efforts that encourage an appreciation of diversity as a strength of our society,\u201d said Ellen Alberding, president of the Joyce Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to support these incredible artists and vital cultural organizations that brilliantly help shape our understanding of each other.\u201d To date, the Joyce Awards have granted $3.5 million to commission 65 new works connecting artists with cultural organizations throughout the Great Lakes region.

In 2005, the gallery and Los Angeles artist Edgar Arceneaux won an award to commission a short 35-mm film installation entitled \u201cThe Alchemy of Comedy.\u201d Gallery 400 and Arceneaux invited students from UIC and two local high schools to participate as both film crew and audience. The $50,000 Joyce award is used to support artists in the creation and production of a new work and provides the commissioning organization the resources needed to engage potential audiences, new partners and their larger communities. \u201cWhat stands out about this cohort of Joyce Award winners is that they are directly taking on the biggest challenges facing their communities,\u201d said Tracie Hall, director of the Joyce Foundation\u2019s Culture Program. \u201cThese artists are asking questions like, \u2018How does a community come together to create its own strategy to address economic disinvestment?\u2019 and \u2018How can communities use art to chronicle and ultimately subvert histories of segregation?\u2019 The weight of these questions has the potential to change the artists, the institutions that have commissioned them, and the communities they engage. That three-fold impact has become the hallmark of the Joyce Awards.\u201d Gallery 400 was founded in 1983 and is located at 400 S. Peoria St. It is one of the nation\u2019s most vibrant university galleries, showcasing work at the leading edge of contemporary art, architecture and design. The gallery\u2019s program of exhibitions, lectures, film and video screenings and performances features interdisciplinary and experimental practices. Operating within the School of Art & Art History in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Gallery 400 endeavors to make the arts and its practitioners accessible to a broad spectrum of the public and to cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual perspectives. Gallery 400 is recognized for its support of the creation of new work, the diversity of its programs and participants, and the development of experimental models for multidisciplinary exhibition. \n\nContact\n\nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n\n\n \nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n Categories \nCampus  Topics art, awards, Latino Carlos Sadovi | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/goldbard_wl_02", "https://today.uic.edu/gallery-400-artist-portrait-adela-goldbard-8024", "https://today.uic.edu/goldbard_paraallegories_pemex", "https://today.uic.edu/author/csadovi", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/art", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/awards", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/latino", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://library.uic.edu": {"text": "Try refreshing the page, or you may need to update your browser.

The Department of Computer Science degree requirements are outlined below. Students should consult the College of Engineering section for additional degree requirements and college academic policies. The Joint Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) is designed for undergraduate students with outstanding academic performance who desire to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science, or who wish to prepare themselves for advanced placement in the workplace. Students will earn both a BSCS and an MSCS degree upon completion, with 8 hours of course work shared between the two degrees. The requirements for completion of the combined BSCS/MSCS degree are identical to the completion of these two separate degrees; however, there are 8 hours of shared course work used for both degrees. Completion of 120 hours at the undergraduate level; plus 8 shared hours counting toward both the BSCS and MSCS degrees; plus 28 hours of course work at the graduate level will result in joint BSCS/MSCS degrees. Students in the BSCS who have only two semesters of course work left and who have at least a 3.60/4.00 grade point average may register for two graduate-level courses (one at the 400 level, and one at the 500 level) and receive 4 hours, instead of 3 hours, for each. The graduate-level courses taken in the senior year will be used at the undergraduate level to fulfill 8 hours of BS selective requirements. At the graduate level these courses will count as required courses. An advisor must approve these courses. Students should apply to the program during their third year, after having completed at least 27 credit hours of CS courses (excluding CS\u00a0398).

Latinos who are exposed to pesticides in their workplaces are twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease compared with Latinos who are not exposed to pesticides at work, according to a new study published in the journal Heart. The study looked at survey questionnaire responses from 7,404 employed Latinos ages 18 to 74 years old enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) regarding occupational exposure to pesticides, metals and solvents \u2014 substances known to have a negative impact on cardiovascular health. The HCHS/SOL is the largest epidemiological study of Hispanics/Latinos and includes more than 16,000 participants from Chicago, San Diego, Miami and the Bronx in New York. Participants were asked whether they had been exposed to metals, solvents or pesticides at work. \u201cRecent studies have linked certain chemicals found in solvents and pesticides and metal dust to cardiovascular disease, but none of those studies looked specifically at Hispanics/Latinos \u2014 a group that is especially vulnerable to exposure to toxins at work,\u201d said Maria Argos, associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health and corresponding author of the paper. En Espanol. About 5 to 9 percent of employed Latinos reported exposure to solvents, metals or pesticides in the workplace. \u201cWhile our study didn\u2019t involve objective measures of exposure to toxic chemicals or metals in blood or urine samples, we observed significantly increased cardiovascular disease, most strongly for atrial fibrillation, among those who self-reported occupational exposure to pesticides,\u201d Argos said. The researchers found that participants reporting occupational exposure to pesticides were twice as likely to have some form of cardiovascular disease compared with those who didn\u2019t report pesticide exposure. Participants reporting exposure to pesticides at work were twice as likely to have coronary heart disease, a type of cardiovascular disease where cholesterol-based plaques accumulate on the walls of the arteries, causing stiffness and increasing the risk for blood clots and stroke. When the researchers looked specifically at atrial fibrillation \u2014 a type of cardiovascular disease characterized by an irregular, often rapid heart rate that can cause poor blood flow \u2014 they found that participants reporting occupational exposure to metals were almost four times as likely to have the disease, and those who reported occupational exposure to pesticides were more than five times as likely to have the disease compared with participants who did not report having these exposures at work. \u201cOur findings strongly suggest that asking patients about their occupational history can help clinicians uncover exposure to toxic chemicals or metals that can contribute to cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Dr. Martha Daviglus, the Edmund F. Foley Professor of Medicine in the UIC College of Medicine, director of UIC\u2019s Institute for Minority Health Research and principal investigator of the HCHS/SOL Chicago Field Center. \u201cWe know that exposure to toxins and metals is damaging to health, and our study corroborates the harmful effects with regards to cardiovascular health. Thus, efforts should be taken to reduce exposure to these substances whenever possible.\u201d Catherine Bulka, Dr. Victoria Persky, Ramon Durazo-Arvizu and Dr. James Lash from the University of Illinois at Chicago; Tali Elfassy, David Lee and Dr. Alberto Ramos from the University of Miami; and Wassim Tarraf from Wayne State University are co-authors on the paper.

Chicago, IL 60607\n\u201cNegotiating ideology and regulation: the planning and governing of public space in Bogota, 1988-2018\u201d\nAbstract: This dissertation argues that the increasing importance of public space in urban planning and politics is fundamentally transforming this discipline into a tool of governmentality. This work specifically explores the linkages between governmentality and planning practices to reflect on the political and on the social construction of the regulatory frameworks that shape the realm within which planning practice exists. It focuses on exploring the ways in which ideological narratives and regulatory concerns about public space intersect within policy-making and planning practice. It proposes that these linkages are much tighter than is generally recognized, and that planning practice could benefit from increasing awareness of the complex negotiation between these aspects This research uses the lens of governmentality and the social construction of public problems to examine the trajectory of planning and governing public space in Bogota through the perspectives of policy instruments and policy-makers. Findings suggest that the negotiation of ideological narratives and regulatory concerns occur in two parallel scales of time, long-term cycles and everyday practices of negotiation. In these two timeframes, politics, agents, institutions, and knowledge continually balance and accommodate ideas and concerns driven by both aspirations to innovate and the requirements of routine daily practices. In the end, this research reasserts the need to continue to examine the social construction of urban problems and their subsequent translation into policy instruments. It also suggests additional lines of inquiry into the intersection between urban planning and governing practice.\nMore Events\nMore Featured Events \u2794\nUIC Calendar of Events \nSubmit an Event \u2794 \nDate/Time\n\tDate(s) - 12/14/20181:00 pm - 3:00 pm\n \nLocation\nCUPPA Hall 4th Floor conference room\n \nCategory(ies)\n\tNo Categories\n Dissertation Defense 12/14: Natalia Villamizar Duarte December 14, 2018, 1:00pm CUPPA Hall, Great Cities Institute (GCI) Suite 400 412 S Peoria, Chicago, IL 60607 \u201cNegotiating ideology and regulation: the planning and governing of public space in Bogota, 1988-2018\u201d Abstract: This dissertation argues that the increasing importance of public space in urban planning and politics is fundamentally transforming this discipline into a tool of governmentality.

Researchers at UIC on the SENSEI Panama Project. (Photo: Lance Long) \u201cThe new system will allow researchers to create and utilize an in-demand computing platform that can rapidly learn to identify anomalies in large data sets and produce visualizations or extract features of interest from images, which will help them hone in on answers to research questions, and even tailor the questions themselves,\u201d said Maxine Brown, director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at UIC and principal investigator on the grant. The grant will support the development of a next-generation composable infrastructure computing system, called COMPaaS DLV for Composable Platform as a Service Instrument for Deep Learning & Visualization. It will be developed and maintained by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and will be initially made available to UIC College of Engineering faculty, many of whom provided use cases for the grant proposal, explaining how they would use this system for research and research education. \u201cCOMPaas DLV will enable faculty to perform complex deep learning and visualization computations on large-scale big data that cannot be efficiently executed on existing computing systems in a timely manner,\u201d said Andrew Johnson, Electronic Visualization Laboratory director of research, associate professor of computer science, and co-principal investigator of the grant. \u201cThe system is flexible and scalable, meaning it can be configured to quickly move, process and store data with few to no bottlenecks.\u201d COMPaaS DLV will be connected to UIC\u2019s existing computing and network resources, managed by the UIC Academic Computing and Communications Center, as well as to regional and national clusters, storage, supercomputing and cloud facilities. Currently, UIC deep learning researchers use small-scale clusters or clouds with graphics processing units. These platforms, while sufficient for moderately sized training jobs, limit the size of data sets and the complexity of neural network codes used as training, and require days and weeks to train sufficiently interesting models. The composable computing platform will enable researchers to \u201ccompose\u201d their own computers, so to speak, creating a temporary, on-demand computer system out of independent components \u2013 computing processors, graphics processing units, storage and networking \u2013 customized to optimally execute their application codes. Traditional computers allocate a \u201cslice\u201d of their system to each application, whether the codes need more or less of each type of component to run efficiently. \u201cGiven it\u2019s a more flexible system, researchers can more quickly analyze big data problems and possibly identify specific subsets of the data they want to focus on or abandon. It\u2019s kind of like how when you get a box lunch, you are stuck with what\u2019s inside that box,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cA composable computer is more like a buffet, where you take as much of what you like and leave what you don\u2019t want behind.\u201d \u201cWith composable computer architecture, the computer\u2019s components form a fluid pool of resources so that different applications with different workflows can run simultaneously, with each configuring the resources it requires almost instantaneously at any time, assuming they are available,\u201d Brown said. \u201cGiven the composable infrastructure\u2019s inherent scalability and agility, it is more beneficial than traditional clouds and clusters that are rigid, over-provisioned and expensive.\u201d One of the applications that will benefit from COMPaaS DLV is SENSEI Panama, a UIC collaborative project with evolutionary anthropologist Meg Crofoot at the University of California, Davis, to enable anthropologists to use virtual reality to \u201cwalk inside their data\u201d and study animal behavior. Crofoot and UIC computer scientists Tanya Berger-Wolf, along with Johnson and Brown, are applying deep learning and visualization to process data from aerial photography, terrain maps, GPS collars, and accelerometers, in order to study how coatis, kinkajous, spider monkeys, and capuchin monkeys on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, forage for food. \u201cComposable architecture is new and not yet readily available from multiple vendors,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut, in the field of computer science, these systems are believed to be the future of computing, analyzing and visualizing Big Data sets.\u201d Part of the grant will go toward the development of a software system to help users interface with the composable platform.

Elisabeta Marai at UIC are co-principal investigators on the grant. \n\nContact\n\nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nResearch \n \nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n Categories \nResearch  Topics big data, composable system, computer systems, deel learning and visualization Sharon Parmet | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/10/sensei.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/big-data", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/composable-system", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer-systems", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/deel-learning-and-visualization", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/uic-launches-new-graduate-degree-in-supply-chain-management": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDecember 13, 2018\t\t\t Chicago is a hub for the movement of goods on a local, national and international scale. (Photo: Fan Wang) Applications are now being accepted for the new master of science in supply chain and operations management launched by the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Business Administration Liautaud Graduate School. The graduate degree program will begin classes on the UIC campus in spring 2019. \u201cThe creation of the master of science in supply chain and operations management degree is a reflection of our commitment to empower students with a dynamic, proven business education, and an immersive city experience full of opportunities that reflect today\u2019s demanding and changing business environment,\u201d said Michael Mikhail, dean of the College of Business Administration. \u201cFurthermore, our students receive the key combination of innovative curriculum and world-class faculty instruction at a value price point to yield a high-value return on investment.\u201d The UIC Business master of science in supply chain and operations management is a 32-credit-hour program that includes 16 hours of required courses and 16 credit hours of electives. The goal is to provide functional knowledge in the areas of integrating analytical modeling approaches; enterprise systems; data, analytics and business intelligence; and developing leadership skills within a global context. \u201cEnterprises are seeking supply chain professionals having a confluence of skill sets in the areas of data and analytics, enterprise systems and technology, and domain knowledge of supply chain functions and related operational processes,\u201d says Matthew Liotine, UIC clinical associate professor of information and decision sciences. \u201cAligning with the present trends, we designed the UIC master of science in supply chain and operations management degree program to fulfill the staffing needs of firms seeking individuals having these skills and this kind of knowledge base.\u201d The program is designed to prepare students for varied work roles, from supply chain planner to manager; logistics coordinator; pricing analyst; procurement specialist; and quality officer, among others. It develops a strong background for supply chain and operations roles in a range of fields, including manufacturing, transportation and logistics, retail, distribution, to pharmaceutical and personal products, health and medical, and food and software systems. As an innovative hub for logistics, UIC is one of only 11 universities in the U.S. named a SAP Next-Gen Chapter, empowering students with technology best practices and future-focused insights. The curriculum features courses in supply chain management, global sourcing and logistics, and applied supply chain strategy and practice. It also incorporates a practicum capstone experience course where students work with a client organization to resolve supply chain and operations issues. The prerequisites to apply include at least one course in managerial statistics or equivalent. Undergraduates with a business degree are welcome to apply, as well as working professionals looking to enhance their skills and capabilities in this field. Those who have completed an eligible UIC undergraduate degree might also qualify for preferred admission, waiving the need for taking a standardized graduate exam, Liotine said. Some additional perks include certifications and recognitions that can be obtained depending on the courses taken. UIC Business graduate students study in the heart of Chicago, a major supply chain and operations hub, with many leading companies in close proximity. According to an article resulting from a 2015 report of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the region\u2019s \u201cconnectedness\u201d makes metropolitan Chicago a hub for the movement of goods on a local, national and international scale, with an estimated $1.3 trillion in goods moving into and out of the region each year.\u00a0 The region\u2019s diverse set of industries trade roughly $365 billion in goods with domestic partners and $245 billion in goods internationally. Applications are currently being accepted for the spring and fall semesters. For more information, to attend an information session or speak to a recruiter, visit the\u00a0master of science in supply chain and operations management\u00a0website. All business programs are accredited by AACSB, the top accreditation organization for business schools; only about 5 percent of the business schools worldwide \u2014 including about 30 percent of U.S. business schools \u2014 have this distinction.

Further, federal regulations require institutions of higher education to disclose information for filing complaints. The information below is intended to provide both institutional and external contact information to current and prospective students. Academic Concerns Students are encouraged to contact their college office to seek advice. The Student Handbook, the undergraduate catalog, and the graduate catalog provide guidance on campus-level policy. If complaints cannot be resolved at the college level or with the help of Student Ombuds Service (see below), the formal mechanism to register student complaints is through the Student Academic Grievance Procedures. They define an administrative process through which students may seek resolution of complaints or grievances regarding academic standing during their enrollment at UIC. Examples of complaints addressed by this process include but are not limited to grade disputes and program dismissals. Note that these procedures may not be used for decisions made as a result of the Student Conduct Process, described below. Other Complaints If a complaint cannot be resolved within the college or the student prefers to speak to someone outside of the college, students have access to several services within the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS). The Student Ombuds Service within the Office of the Dean of Students provides an impartial advocate for fairness who investigates student complaints. The Ombudsperson may serve as a counselor, go-between, mediator, or informal fact finder. Some of the matters which may be addressed by this service include grade disputes / grievance procedures, student record errors, billing / financial issues and registration problems. The Student Conduct Process within the Office of the Dean of Students is also available to any student, university employee, or community member with a complaint about a UIC student. They can file a student misconduct incident report or academic integrity incident report form regarding possible violations of the University Standards of Conduct, which is included in the Student Disciplinary Policy. The Office for Access and Equity strives to increase access to employment, programs, and services in an environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. As part of the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) is the office charged with reviewing and addressing complaints of harassment and/or discrimination. This includes sex discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and retaliation. Students may file a complaint internally using the established reporting process on the OAE website. UIC is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, services, and all activities at UIC. Students with complaints or concerns about accessibility issues on campus can submit an Online Report of UIC Accessibility Issues available at the UIC Disability Resources website. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) receives these reports and follows up with different units on campus based on the nature of the complaint. If the student experiences discrimination based on disability it should be reported directly to the Office of Access and Equity (OAE). External Resources If a student's complaint cannot be resolved by the University, a complaint may be filed with the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which regulates higher education institutions in Illinois, through their Complaint System; or the student may contact the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), UIC's regional accrediting agency, through their Complaint Process. Online Education Complaint Resolution Students enrolled in Online or Distance Education courses are encouraged to contact their respective college office to seek advice. Since the University of Illinois at Chicago has been approved as an institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) initiative by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA), students enrolled from participating SARA states, as indicated by the State Authorization webpage, follow the SARA Complaint Resolution Process. Such students may contact the Illinois Board of Higher Education (the Illinois SARA portal agency) with complaints that were not resolved through the student campus complaint procedures described above by accessing the IBHE online complaint system. Students enrolled in programs in states outside of SARA contact their own state agencies with complaints that were not resolved through the student UIC campus complaint procedures described above. Online students with questions about complaint procedures may also contact UIC Extended Campus at onlineinfo@uic.edu or at (312) 355-0423.

Afterward, however, both can say they rocked the UIC Pavilion. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting because we are kind of the exact opposite of Travis Scott,\u201d Jonathan Dombro, a senior in economics and lead singer of Splor, said hours before taking the stage. That they were. Splor, winner of the 2016 Battle of the Bands event hosted by UIC Radio, hit leadoff in Spark 2016\u2019s order and played rock songs that engaged a crowd that came mostly for two rappers. The genuine elation and modesty Splor expressed through song-transition \u201cthank yous\u201d brought cheers from the UIC audience. While Scott forgot his \u201cthank yous\u201d at Hallmark, his set was as wild as advertised. The rapper delivered his typical high-energy performance that makes his shows must-see. UIC\u2019s free music festival featured student performers Splor. (Photo: Elizabeth Monge) \u201cScott was well worth the wait,\u201d said Shanice Kloss, a junior in economics. \u201cFrom start to finish he was pumped up.\u201d \u201cAntidote,\u201d which rose to No. 16 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, was belted by nearly every crowd member on the floor, but the most creative part of Scott\u2019s theatre may have been his nod to Chicago. To the crowd\u2019s pleasure, Scott rapped and danced to Kanye West\u2019s hit, \u201cFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1.\u201d Then he performed the late Speaker Knockerz\u2019 \u201cLonely.\u201d While Speaker Knockerz wasn\u2019t raised in Chicago, his sound resonated all over the city because of the drill components. It would be remiss not to mention the way Alex Corral of Nexus & Aztro ignited the crowd during his set. Corral, performing by himself, proved why he won UIC\u2019s last DJ Battle by reading the audience\u2019s vibe and spinning to it. Daya and Young Thug also commanded the Pavilion stage. While Daya gave the community a surprise taste of her new music, Young Thug, also known as Jeffery, played through the hits. His rendition of \u201cLifestyle\u201d was fire. At the end, the UIC community walked out the doors having heard diverse sound from all genres. \u201cOverall, Spark was awesome this year,\u201d Kloss said. \u201cI was a little disappointed when they decided to move it to the Pavilion, but the performances were really good.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nTim Goldrick\n\ntgoldr2@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nStudents \n \nTim Goldrick\n\ntgoldr2@uic.edu\n Categories \nStudents  Topics Spark, Spark in the Park Tim Goldrick | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://news.uic.edu/files/2016/09/2016_9-1-16_Spark-3.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/tgoldr2", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/spark", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/spark-in-the-park", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://outlook.uic.edu": {"text": "JavaScript is required.

(Photo: Troy Heinzeroth) With no network suits or pestering TMZ journalists lurking, comedian Leslie Jones told the UIC community she felt free during her \u201cLOL@UIC\u201d performance Jan. 26. Jones, a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member and writer, demonstrated that liberation with an hour-long stand-up routine that featured everything from a hilariously uncomfortable Prince encounter to playing matchmaker with students. The result: a memorable show that had the crowd rolling. \u201cThe highlight of the show in my opinion was just hearing all the laughter throughout,\u201d event lead Sunil Dommaraju said. \u201cIt was refreshing to hear such a loud roar every time a great joke was made.\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Leslie Jones performs at the UIC Forum. (Photo: Troy Heinzeroth) \u201cLOL@UIC,\u201d presented by UIC\u2019s Student Activities Board, offered students, faculty and staff an opportunity to see first-rate comedy for free. They took advantage by packing the UIC Forum to see a smoothly run presentation. \u201cI think it went really well,\u201d Dommaraju said. \u201cThe show started on time. The artists transitioned nicely. The show was hilarious. A lot of people came to the event as well, which is always great.\u201d Jones received the loudest chuckles when talking about her own promiscuous lifestyle and venturing into the crowd to tease certain audience members. It was all in good spirit, as the 49-year-old comedian seemed genuinely elated to return to stand-up comedy. \u201cWithout a doubt, my favorite part of the event was when Leslie Jones came down from the stage and started walking through the crowd and interacting with UIC students,\u201d said Almasa Pecanin, president of UIC\u2019s Student Activities Board. \u201cThere were students standing up from their seats to see who she was speaking to and if it was someone they know. There were also students trying to get Leslie\u2019s attention so they can be the next ones she talked to. \u201cI thought that was so funny, and must have been such a crazy experience for the students who had a chance to interact with her.\u201d The event wasn\u2019t all about Jones, though. Opener Jon Laster did more than just warm up the crowd. Laster questioned the audience on majors, class status and partying habits, then built brilliantly humorous responses off their answers. He also put a unique spin on racial quips, accentuating tendencies of white women to overly rely on their fathers. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to laugh as much as I did,\u201d said David Pisanski, a senior in computer engineering. \u201cI thought Jon Laster\u2019s opening act was hilarious, especially his girls and their dads bit.\u201d At the end of the show, Pisanski and other students in attendance left with a wide grin. \u201cThis was my first time going to LOL,\u201d Pisanski said. \u201cI\u2019m happy they were able to organize such a fun and free event for students. Looking back, I wish I went to the ones I missed.\u201d \u201cI think during difficult times, it\u2019s important to find a positive outlet to release your tension and anxieties,\u201d Pecanin added. \u201cLeslie addressed issues in society, college life, and other things in a comedic tone, so students would be able to laugh about them rather than letting them consume their thoughts.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nTim Goldrick\n\ntgoldr2@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nCampus \n \nTim Goldrick\n\ntgoldr2@uic.edu\n Categories \nCampus  Topics LOL, LOL@UIC, Student Activities Board Tim Goldrick | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://news.uic.edu/files/2017/01/2017__lol_leslie_jones_011.jpg", "https://news.uic.edu/files/2017/01/2017__lol_leslie_jones_039v.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/tgoldr2", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/lol", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/loluic", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/student-activities-board", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://gradstudentcouncil.uic.edu": {"text": "  \u00a9 2013 UIC GSC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\tThe University of Illinois at Chicago\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\tWebsite Support: Engin Yapici\n\n ", "out_links": ["http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/studentgovt/index.shtml"]}, "http://hpsc.org.uic.edu": {"text": "\nWORLD HEALTH DAYProgram Launch of \"Living global health\"Luncheon and Discussion**Lunch Provided**Tuesday, April 7, 201511:30-12:45pmSchool of Public Health I Room 932\u00a0\"Living\u00a0global\u00a0health\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0accessible\u00a0social\u00a0conversation\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0realities\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0health,globally,\u00a0through\u00a0our\u00a0own\u00a0personal\u00a0stories\u00a0and\u00a0reflections.\u00a0We\u00a0are\u00a0providing\u00a0a\u00a0platform\u00a0to\u00a0share\u00a0ourstories.\u00a0We\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0prompting\u00a0the\u00a0world\u00a0to\u00a0respond\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0series\u00a0of\u00a0questions,\u00a0Real\u00a0Voices\u00a0that\u00a0aredirected\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0global\u00a0audience,\u00a0as\u00a0individuals.\u00a0Through\u00a0this\u00a0initiative\u00a0we\u00a0will\u00a0gather\u00a0real\u00a0voices\u00a0fromindividuals\u00a0everywhere\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0raise\u00a0awareness\u00a0and\u00a0begin\u00a0a\u00a0truly\u00a0global\u00a0conversation\u00a0throughsocial\u00a0media\u00a0about\u00a0health\u00a0equity.PLEASE RSVP BY ENTERING YOUR NAME ON THE DOODLE POLL:\u00a0http://doodle.com/bdvdsdcfpfg2px3c\u201d\n \u00a0 \"Living\u00a0global\u00a0health\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0accessible\u00a0social\u00a0conversation\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0realities\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0health,globally,\u00a0through\u00a0our\u00a0own\u00a0personal\u00a0stories\u00a0and\u00a0reflections.\u00a0We\u00a0are\u00a0providing\u00a0a\u00a0platform\u00a0to\u00a0share\u00a0ourstories.\u00a0We\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0prompting\u00a0the\u00a0world\u00a0to\u00a0respond\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0series\u00a0of\u00a0questions,\u00a0Real\u00a0Voices\u00a0that\u00a0aredirected\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0global\u00a0audience,\u00a0as\u00a0individuals.\u00a0Through\u00a0this\u00a0initiative\u00a0we\u00a0will\u00a0gather\u00a0real\u00a0voices\u00a0fromindividuals\u00a0everywhere\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0raise\u00a0awareness\u00a0and\u00a0begin\u00a0a\u00a0truly\u00a0global\u00a0conversation\u00a0throughsocial\u00a0media\u00a0about\u00a0health\u00a0equity.

The University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s newest student housing community will be one of the leading edge mixed-use, live-learn student communities in the country, housing more than 550 students on the UIC campus. This project is a response to UIC\u2019s record-setting Fall 2017 enrollment and reinforces the current growth strategy to support the recruitment, retention, and graduation\u00a0of its students. The community is being developed in partnership with American Campus Communities, with designs by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and general contractor Pepper/Brown Construction Company. Interim Housing allows residential students to stay on campus\u00a0in between academic terms. Students may request a late departure after finals, an early arrival before the start of the spring term, or a full-period stay.

The African-American Cultural Center (AACC) supports the academic and diversity missions of the University by engaging UIC faculty, staff, students, community partners, and other stakeholders in programs and initiatives that contextualize, highlight, present, and critically examine Black diaspora traditions, histories, and experiences. We envision the Center as a safe, brave, and inclusive hub for collaboration, creative and scholarly practice, engaged learning, service, and social justice. As the first Arab American Cultural Center on a college campus in the United States, the ARABAMCC is a welcoming space for Arab and Muslim students seeking to build community and anyone interested in fostering solidarity and cultural diversity on campus. \u00a0  The Asian American Resource and Cultural Center (AARCC) opened in Spring of 2005 as a result of student efforts to ensure that UIC supports the needs of Asian Americans. AARCC promotes the intellectual and personal growth of UIC students, staff, and faculty; advocates for greater access, equity, and inclusion of Asian Americans; and educates the UIC community about Asian Americans. \u00a0 The Disability Cultural Center (DCC) was established as a new Center in the Spring of 2018 to continue engaging in cultural, social, and educational programming, and community outreach to advance understanding of the disability experience as a source of pride, knowledge, and artistic expression.\u00a0 The DCC is guided by the understanding that identity is multi-dimensional, involving the intersections of disability, race, class, gender, sexuality, religious affiliation, and geographic location, among others. \u00a0 The Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC) promotes deeply engaged and life affirming thinking, learning, and action for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community members. Programs are informed by an understanding of intersecting identities and diversity within LGBTQIA+ communities. \u00a0 The Latino Cultural Center (LCC) engages campus and local communities to deepen understanding of the diverse cultural heritages and identities of Latinx, issues affecting their lives, and creative solutions they are using to improve community life. The LCC offers engaged learning co-curricular opportunities that feature cultural and artistic expressions, intercultural and civic dialogues, scholarly presentations, and first-voice stories. Through institutional interventions, support, advocacy, and education, our mission at the Women\u2019s Leadership and Resource Center (WLRC) is to create a welcoming and equitable environment in which women and women-identified people are able to pursue their educational and career aspirations, free from institutional barriers, oppression, and violence. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site     | ", "out_links": ["http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://chancellor.uic.edu/", "http://provost.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://diversity.uic.edu/engagement/", "http://aacc.uic.edu", "http://aacc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2018/05/annualReport_print.compressed.pdf", "http://arabamcc.uic.edu", "https://arabamcc.uic.edu/files/2017/08/AnnualReport2016-17-ii.pdf", "http://aarcc.uic.edu", "http://dcc.uic.edu", "http://gsc.uic.edu", "http://latinocultural.uic.edu", "http://latinocultural.red.uic.edu/reserve-gallery/annual-reports-documents/", "http://wlrc.uic.edu", "https://wlrc.uic.edu/files/2013/11/WLRC_CAN_Annual-Report_2015-16.pdf", "http://diversity.uic.edu/engagement/", "http://heritagegarden.uic.edu/", "http://gsc.uic.edu/safe-zone/", "https://latinocultural.uic.edu/programs/dialogues-tours/", "http://uic.edu", "http://diversity.uic.edu", "http://go.uic.edu/uicare", "http://dos.uic.edu", "http://counseling.uic.edu", "http://oae.uic.edu/", "http://dream.uic.edu", "http://ois.uic.edu", "http://ask.uic.edu", "http://policies.uic.edu/uic-policy-library/access-and-equity/nondiscrimination-policy-statement/", "https://uic.edu/", "https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "https://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "https://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "https://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/eventcal/eventcal.fcgi", "https://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "https://library.uic.edu/", "https://maps.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/", "https://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet": {"text": "December 12, 2018 Casi el 9 por ciento de los latinos empleados reportaron estar expuestos a solventes, metales o pesticidas en el lugar de trabajo.

Graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., CS 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Check your registration to ensure you meet the restrictions on registration of CS classes. The Master of Science program is designed for students who have received their undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and wish to develop greater depth and/or breadth in computer science. The MS degree prepares students for more challenging\u2013and often more highly-compensated\u2013work in their professional careers. UIC Computer Science MS alumni have traditionally been well-positioned for interesting and rewarding careers. MS degree could be completed with a Coursework, Project or Thesis Option. Full-time, well-prepared, highly motivated students may complete the program in as few as three semesters; most students complete the program in four to six semesters of residence. Detailed MS degree requirements are published below: The Doctor of Philosophy program is designed for students who have received their MS degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and who wish to develop greater depth and breadth in computer science, with particular emphasis on the development of expertise in Computer Science research. The PhD degree prepares students for the most challenging\u2013and often most highly-compensated\u2013work in the field of Computer Science. Typically, PhD graduates are employed in commercial or industrial research, or themselves become faculty members in Computer Science departments throughout the world. Exceptional applicants who have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, or a related field, and wish to pursue a PhD will be considered for a \u201cDirect PhD Admission\u201d. Such students will pursue the PhD degree without the requirement or option of first completing a Master degree. Detailed PhD degree requirements are published below: Financial Aid Information Department financial aid is available in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships and tuition fee waivers. Students on good standing as defined by the department standards can be nominated and/or awarded any type of aid. \u00a0 Fellowships Various fellowships are available through the Graduate College and outside foundations. \u00a0Students and faculty are notified periodically of these fellowships and deadlines.\u00a0 Fellowships available through outside foundations may require students to be Permanent Residents or citizens of the US. \u00a0Consult the \u2018Funding your Education\u2019 section of the graduate college website (http://grad.uic.edu/funding-your-education) for awards available through the graduate college and general information on the fellowships and funding..

It is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs. \u00a0The Dean\u2019s Scholar competition is open to doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College required Preliminary Examination at the University of Illinois at Chicago and are well into their dissertation work. \u00a0 Application Procedures: \u00a0Deadlines for UIC fellowships and other awards administered through the Graduate College are established jointly by the Awards Committee of the Graduate College and the Graduate College. \u00a0Since departments need to submit nominations to the Graduate College (wherever it states \u201cdepartment nominations due\u201d), complete application is due to the CS Student Affairs office at least 5-7 days prior to the Graduate College deadline. \u00a0Recommendation letters should be in electronic format and submitted directly by the recommender to the CS Student Affairs office (grad@cs.uic.edu). Non UIC fellowships have their own submission rules. Students should contact the CS Student Affairs office for any questions upon announcement of the fellowships. Upon announcement of the deadlines for the fellowships offered by the graduate college, students interested in applying should talk to their advisor first and with consultation must submit an Application for Graduate Appointment, statement of purpose, resume with publications and three recommendation letters (one from advisor) to the CS Student Affairs Office. \u00a0The Director of Graduate Studies will select from among the applicants and submit nominations for consideration by the Graduate College Awards Committee, which makes the final recommendation to the Dean. Chancellor\u2019s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program: This program supports increased multidisciplinary scholarship opportunities and exposure to careers in research and creative fields for graduate and professional students. Successful applicants must show exceptional promise for future multidisciplinary research and creative activity in their fields of interest. \u00a0Funding will allow graduate or professional candidates to supplement existing stipends with a 0% fellowship appointment for the fellowship period. Applications will be evaluated not only on the quality of the prospective student, but also the quality of the proposed project and mentored experience. A faculty mentor will direct the project but it is expected that the student will play the major role in the writing of this application. \u00a0Consult the graduate college web site for details on the program and application procedure. \u00a0 \u00a0 Teaching Assistantships for Continuing Students Teaching Assistantships (TA\u2019s) are awarded to students with outstanding academic records. \u00a0TA\u2019s assist in the teaching and grading of CS course work under the direction of the course instructor. \u00a0The assistantship includes a monthly stipend and waiver of tuition and fees.\u00a0 Details of waiver are available at http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships, stipends for Computer Science students are higher than minimum specified. Amount: Current monthly stipend is approximately $2,084 ($2,145 for students who passed the PhD qualifier) and a tuition and fee waiver. The stipend is subject to change, all fees are not covered by the waiver. \u00a0 Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply. \u00a0Graduates of foreign institutions should have the Oral Certification from the ITA office.\u00a0 These are the minimum requirements for TA eligibility; many factors determine the offers of TA positions. \u00a0 Application Procedure: Decisions for the following academic year (fall and spring semesters) are made during the Summer. \u00a0Students must complete and submit the online application when it is open.\u00a0 Students are notified via UIC email when the application is open. \u00a0TA positions are generally assigned for the academic year (fall and spring); thus very few TA positions are available for the spring semesters. \u00a0Applications for Spring semester are available in December. Registration Requirement: At least 8 hours in Fall and Spring. Students are not required need to register in Summer, but must register for at least 3 hours to receive the tuition and service fee waiver. English Proficiency: Illinois State Law requires all international teaching assistants providing instruction in classroom, discussion group, laboratory, or office hour situations to be certified proficient in speaking and communicating in English. The CS Department requires ALL graduate students appointed as Graduate Teaching Assistants pass the Oral Certification administered by the International Teaching Assistant Program. \u00a0Graduate students who received their undergraduate degree in the United States or from a country in which the primary language is English are not required to receive the Certification. \u00a0Information on the ITA program can be obtained from \u00a0http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page /. \u00a0 \u00a0 Tuition and Fee Waiver A limited number of tuition and fee waivers are available to the department through Graduate College. These awards provide an exemption from tuition fee, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA and partial cost of \u00a0Campus Care health insurance (Fall & Spring only).\u00a0 Students must be registered for 12 hours of study during the entire semester in which they receive the waiver.\u00a0 A student who drops below the 12 hour requirement at any time in the semester will be responsible for all tuition and service fees. \u00a0 Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply. Application Procedure: Decisions for the Fall semester are made during the Summer. \u00a0Students must complete and submit the online completed application when it is open. \u00a0Students are contacted via UIC email when the application is open.\u00a0 Applications for the Spring semester are available in December. Registration Requirement: \u00a0At least 12 hours in Fall and Spring and 6 hours in Summer. \u00a0 Research Assistantships Students are encouraged to contact faculty members with shared research interests directly. The faculty member, depending on the availability of grant money determines the term and eligibility requirements of the appointment. CS Graduate Student Processes Course Selection All graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest. \u00a0PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition. \u00a0New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year. Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research. \u00a0Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester. \u00a0 Registration Restrictions* \u2013 CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS. \u00a0 How is it implemented? Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905). \u00a0We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs. *The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed. \u00a0 Other course processes Some 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation. \u00a0If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course. Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester. \u00a0See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships: http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships. \u00a0Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer. \u00a0Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees. The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework. \u00a0Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively. \u00a0 Course Prerequisites If your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses. \u00a0 Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing Courses Students should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms). \u00a0Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes. Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class. \u00a0Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review. As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS). \u00a0If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a \u201clate drop\u201d, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript. \u00a0A \u201cW\u201d cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade. The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: \u201cI have had this material before\u201d, \u201cThis course will not be useful to me\u201d, \u201cI am taking too many courses\u201d, \u201cI do not have the prerequisites\u201d, \u201cI forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline\u201d, \u201cA bad grade will affect my GPA negatively\u201d or \u201cI have not attended classes for the past few weeks\u201d. \u00a0It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites. Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply. Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students. \u00a0In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission. \u00a0 Good Academic Standing In addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty. \u00a0 Grades Coursework earn grades of A, B, C, D or F; research hours a \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018U\u2019. \u00a0GPA is calculated based on the grades and credits hours.\u00a0 For details see: http://grad.uic.edu/grades. \u00a0 Probation and Academic Dismissal All graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 (B) grade point average (GPA). \u00a0The GPA calculation does not include independent study and research courses (CS 590, CS 595-599). Graduate course work must be satisfied by a C grade or higher. \u00a0If a student\u2019s graduate GPA falls below 3.0 (B), the Graduate College will issue a letter of warning and impose academic probation for a specified period of time. \u00a0Failure to comply with the terms will likely result in dismissal from the CS program and Graduate College.\u00a0 Details of this available at: http://grad.uic.edu/probation-and-academic-dismissal. A student on probation is ineligible for department awarded financial aid, recommendation for any type of practical training, or graduation. Instructional Computing Facilities The Computer Science Department maintains an instructional computing facility and remote servers, which serve its students\u2019 computing needs for CS coursework. \u00a0 Student Access: Each new student is assigned a CS account which expires one year after graduation. Your login may be checked at http://go.uic.edu/csaccount and passwords are initially set to the student\u2019s UIN. We highly encourage users to change their passwords after their initial login. * Students are given a space quota of 1 GB and print quota of 600 pages/semester. Accounts can be accessed by logging on to the lab workstations or remote servers, allowing students the flexibility to complete their course work from the lab, home or work. \u00a0 The facility consists of the following equipment: Department Workstations: * 52 Linux machines (CentOS7) * 1 printer * 4 LCD monitors for student collaboration Department Remote Servers: * bert.cs.uic.edu * ernie.cs.uic.edu * systems.cs.uic.edu \u00a0 CS Instructional Laboratory\u00a0 Location: 2nd floor of SEL (room 2254). Lab Hours: Monday \u2013 Thursday 8am \u2013 11pm | Friday 8am \u2013 9pm (During the Fall and Spring semesters) \u00a0 In case of problems or error, please contact the lab consultant on duty or email support@cs.uic.edu Department Computer Policy The University of Illinois at Chicago and the department of computer science are committed to providing an educational environment that is accessible to all students. In accordance with this commitment, students in need of accommodations due to a disability should contact the Disability Resource Center or Phone (312) 413-2183 for verification and determination of reasonable accommodations as soon as possible. Departmental Information for TAs Once a student has accepted a TA position, he/she must request any changes to their TA appointment at least two weeks prior to the start of classes. \u00a0Resigning the TAship at the last minute or after the semester begins; and unavailability for TA duties on the first day of classes is unacceptable and will negatively reflect future TA/TFW consideration. New international student TA\u2019s must pass the Oral Certification by the end of their 1st semester. \u00a0Information can be obtained from ITA website at http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page. Once the TA assignment has been finalized, the TA should contact their instructor to introduce themselves, become familiar with the requirements of the course and instructor and understand the TA duties. \u00a0Whether you are working as an assistant in a lab or course or a grader it is essential that you contact the instructor prior to the start of classes. Helpful information and questions you should ask before classes begin: Course information TA Responsibilities \u201cIf there is a Problem\u201d What is the best way to reach the professor? \u00a0By email? Office number and phone? Home phone? When is the best time? General Information Academic Misconduct It is mandatory for all TA\u2019s to be present during TA orientation and ready for TA duties on the first day of classes. \u00a0TA\u2019s who will be away during the December break must make arrangements to arrive by these dates. Mailboxes Mailboxes are not provided to any CS graduate students. \u00a0If a class requires paper submission of assignments, TA should notify the CS Student Affairs for submission options. \u00a0The faculty and staff mailboxes are located in the Main office (1120 SEO).\u00a0 If you want to drop off something for a faculty or staff \u2013 visit the main office to locate the appropriate box. \u00a0No personal mail should be sent to the department address; the department will NOT be responsible for any lost mail. \u00a0 Offices We do our best to provide a TA office to all TAs but have limited space available. \u00a0If you intend to use your lab space for office hours \u2013 contact your advisor to verify this is acceptable and inform the CS Student Affairs Office of the office information. No personal items, food, refrigerator, toasters, coffee machines etc. should be stored in TA offices. This is a shared space designed to help you fulfill your TA duties. \u00a0The space must be kept clean and in good working order. It is your responsibility to ensure your students respect the office space. If you plan on graduating soon and would like to have a Graduation Check done, send an e-mail with your name and UIN to the Student Affairs Office.  MS and PhD graduation requirements are available in your respective Graduate Program Requirements Manual above. Read through Graduation Guidelines for the graduation process. Quick links to various graduations forms: Other General Information \u00a0 Curricular Practical Training is permission to work off-campus at an internship while you are enrolled at the University for International students. \u00a0CPT is handled through the College of Engineering\u2019s Engineering Career Center (http://ecc.uic.edu/). The Computer Science department does not allow any students who are not on good standing (GPA below 3.0) to participate in this program. \u00a0 The Computer Science department will allow you to go for optional practical training (OPT) and will give approval for such training at the conclusion of your degree. You must be on good and full standing to get approval for OPT. If you were admitted on limited standing and have not satisfied the requirements or your GPA is less than 3.0 (B), you will not be given approval for OPT until the requirements have been met. You must start this process very early; contact the Office of International Services (OIS) in SSB for the guidelines on the process. \u00a0The OPT authorization/approval required by OIS can be provided only by the staff in the CS Student Affairs Office.\u00a0 Approval from advisors is not acceptable. \u00a0 All new students who enroll at UIC are automatically enrolled in an insurance plan and the UIC student health care program consisting of two components \u2013CampusCare (http://campuscare.uic.edu/), a comprehensive student health insurance program to cover you for loss due to a covered injury or illness, and the UIC Department of Family Medicine, which provides you, via your health service fee, with coverage for routine care including physical examinations. For registered students, coverage is continuous, beginning with the first day of the term until the first day of the next term. Students have the option to waive the insurance coverage by completing a waiver form and presenting evidence of other comparable insurance coverage (copy of your insurance card). The waiver forms and deadlines are available on the CampusCare website. \u00a0Students who had previously waived the plan will remain waived, but may apply for the CampusCare insurance plan, subject to a determination of eligibility if they desire to be reinstated. Dependents (spouse and children) may be added to the coverage after filling out a Dependent Application, for an additional fee. \u00a0 Any changes to your name, address, telephone number or current address have to be reported to the UIC Records Office in SSB, the CS Student Affairs Office of Computer Science, Office of International Services (if you are on any kind of visa) and Human Resources (HR) (if you are working as TA/RA/GA at UIC). \u00a0Changes with records can be done through your my.UIC.edu account and for OIS report to your International services advisor directly.\u00a0 To report changes to the CS department you can e-mail Elena or Santhi.\u00a0 HR go to http://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/ to change your address so that the W2 for that year is mailed to the correct address. All requests for letters should be submitted via e-mail to the CS graduate email \u2018grad@cs.uic.edu\u2019 for the CS Student Affairs Office. \u00a0The request should include your name, UIN, degree and details of the information needed in the letter. Letters are usually processed and ready for pick up within 1-2 business days, an email will be sent when the letter is ready. \u00a0Walk-in requests are not accommodated.\u00a0 Below are the most common letters requested: You represent the department as you interact with the UIC community. \u00a0We expect all our students to conduct themselves in a courteous, respectful and professionalism manner. If you have a grievance related to a particular course please discuss it with the instructor first and see if the issue can be resolved. If you are not satisfied with the response from the instructor, stop by the CS Student Affairs Office or make an appointment to speak with the DGS (dgs@cs.uic.edu).

We are one of the leading research departments at UIC, with annual research funding exceeding $9 million. Five of our professors have won UIC\u2019s top teaching prize, the Award for Excellence in Teaching, awarded to only three to five professors from the entire UIC campus each year. We have about 850 undergraduate majors, 150 masters students, and 100 PhD students. We are also proud of our connections to the community and region, with research and outreach programs serving the City of Chicago, local public schools, transportation systems, and more. Welcome message from Bob Sloan, Department Head The Computer Science Department offers three degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (including concentrations in Computer Systems and Software Engineering), the Master of Science in Computer Science, and the Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science. Our academic programs are designed to prepare students for successful careers in a rapidly evolving discipline, and we place a strong emphasis on design principles and practice. Computer Science remains an outstanding major for these difficult times. Our graduates continue to find excellent jobs, and equally important, Computer Science empowers you to do good: to connect technology to your world. We are a department both old and new. The University of Illinois at Chicago was founded in 1965, and as Computer Science grew as a field, Computer Science faculty were housed in the Department of Information Engineering, which in 1982 became the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In July 2001, Computer Science became a department in its own right.   Department of Computer Science  851 S.

Students can apply to the majority of these engineering scholarships by completing the applications on their page or application available in room 123 Science and Engineering Offices (SEO). The Department of Computer Science offers scholarships as they become available.  For current scholarship opportunities available with us, please contact  ugrad@cs.uic.edu.  The SFS (Scholarships for Service) in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance - Recipients receive tuition and a $20,000 annual stipend and after graduation must work in cybersecurity for a number of years equal to the number of years that they received the scholarship. This is open to both BS and MS students. 5-year duration, September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2017. The program supports junior and senior students interested in cyber-security and electronic security courses.  Contact Prof. Venkat (venkat @ uic.edu) for details. Graduate college site on 'Funding your Education' is a good place to start on understanding funding your education in general. They give general information on all types of funding and how to go about finding it. The CS department has teaching assistantships (TA), research assistantships (RA), tution fee waivers (TFW) and department endorsed fellowships offered by the graduate college. Teaching Assistantship applications are available, through the student affairs office, at the end of Fall/Spring semester for the following semester/academic year to continuing graduate students. Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members and we encourage you to contact the faculty in your research interests for availability. Limited number of tution waivers from the graduate college are available for the department each semester, applications for these are the same as for TA. Graduate college has a number of Fellowships for continuing students that have to be endorsed by the department. The fellowships indicated below are required to be submitted and/or sponsored by the director of graduate studies (DGS) and so the deadline for these is weeks/days ahead of the graduate college deadline. All deadlines indicated are department deadlines, by which all necessary application materials and recommendation lettes have to be submitted to the DGS/Student Affairs Office. US Citizens and Immigrants should contact the UIC Financial Aid Office for information on student loans and grants. There are several forms of financial aid available to incoming graduate students.   UIC University Fellowship One of the most prestigious and thus the most competitive form of financial aid is the UIC University Fellowship. The department has to nominate applicants for this award. To be considered for nomination to the University Fellowship, your application must be complete by and ready for review by mid January. These deadlines are strictly enforced. Teaching Assistantship Teaching Assistantships are awarded to applicants with outstanding academic records, in addition to proven communication skills. TA\u2019s assist in the teaching and grading of course work under the supervision and direction of an assigned instructor. Decisions regarding TA\u2019s for the Fall semester are typically made mid March. Awarded applicants are contacted via email. A typical award of this type is a 50% appointment which requires the student to work 20 hours/week of their TA duties. The stipend for this award was $18,229 for the 2016-17 academic year. In addition the award carries a waiver of tuition, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable. All other fees are the responsibility of the student. Research Assistantship Research assistantships are awarded by individual faculty members based on their needs and available research funding. RA\u2019s assist faculty in funded research projects.  Applicants interested in these should contact faculty (link to faculty page) in their area of research directly after being admitted by the department.  Be selective in your correspondence to only the faculty whose research interests match your own; faculty are generally non-responsive to \"broadcast\" appeals for financial aid.  Stipend is similar to teaching assistantship Tuition and Fee Waiver A limited number of Tuition and Fee waivers are available on a competitive basis for PhD students. These cover the cost of all tuition (including differential), service fee, health service fee, academic facilities maintenance fund assessment, library and information technology assessment, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable. All other fees are the financial responsibility of the student. These waivers are usually not awarded until just prior to the beginning of the semester. After admission and arrival at the university, please stop by the Student Affairs Office for further information on an application for this award. IGERT Fellowship A limited number of IGERT Fellowships are available on a competitive basis for incoming or current PhD students. Due to requirements by NSF, these Fellowships are available only for US citizens or permanent residents. These Fellowships offer a stipend plus Tuition and Fee waiver. The application for these fellowships must be sent to the ESP-IGERT program. For more details about this program and application procedures, please visit http://securityigert.uic.edu.

The project aims to complement available campus computing resources via the campus\u2019s research network. It will be able to\u00a0access local and remote computing and storage facilities funded, including XSEDE, Blue Waters, Deep Learning Instrument and Chameleon. This critical instrumentation will\u00a0provide a platform to pursue fundamental science and engineering research training in deep learning (data mining and data analytics, computer vision, natural language\u00a0processing, artificial intelligence), visualization (simulation, rendering, visual analytics, video steaming, image processing), and a combination of deep learning and\u00a0visualization (e.g., when data is so large that it cannot be easily visualized, then deep learning is used to extract features of interest to be visualized). The instrumentation\u00a0also enables investigation and contribution to societal issues in disciplines such as anthropology, biology, cybersecurity, data-literacy, fraud detection, healthcare,\u00a0manufacturing, urban sustainability, and cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous cars). Its design utilizes state-of-the-art computer architecture, known as composable architecture, in which the computer\u2019s components (traditional processor, GPU, storage, and\u00a0networking) form a fluid pool of resources, such that different applications with different workflows can be run simultaneously, with each configuring the resources it requires\u00a0almost instantaneously, at any time. Given composable infrastructure scalability and agility, it is more beneficial than traditional clouds and clusters that are rigid,\u00a0overprovisioned, and expensive. \u00a0    Notice:  get_currentuserinfo is deprecated since version 4.5.0!

These gatherings are targeted towards prospective students who are currently either high school juniors or seniors or are considering transferring from a community college. Parents and friends are also welcome. Open House gatherings will be held on the dates shown below, many of which are days when Chicago Public Schools and some suburban districts do not have school: Computer Science Student Volunteers at the campus-wide open house on Sept. 22nd. UIC Preview is an opportunity to visit and hear from financial aid, housing and undergraduate colleges. This is a half-day program with campus and residence hall tours. 8AM\u00a0 \u2013 1PM | UIC Student Center East (750 S. Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60607) Do you have specific questions about Computer Science at UIC? Email:  recruit@cs.uic.edu Phone: call Elena or Christina at (312) 413-4950 The Open House information will apply to both categories of entering students. Transfer students should also see the engineering transfer student school guides.  We have various starting points in our program, accommodating both students who have never taken computer science courses as well as students who already have an extensive background.  Though content is geared primarily towards students, participating in an Open House will give you a good perspective on Computer Science in general and our program in particular.  No, there is no cost, nor are you obligated in any way. This is simply an opportunity for you to learn more about what it would be like to study CS at UIC.  For Computer Science Open House events that are on the same date as university-wide events, we encourage you to attend the university and college portions as well, however you may attend only the Computer Science portion if you are already familiar with the university and the college. If this is the case, please include a comment to this effect when you register.  See this website.  The Computer Science Department is one of six departments within the College of Engineering, which in turn is one of many colleges that are part of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). If you would like information on the College as a whole, visit the\u00a0College of Engineering website.\u00a0Often the College as a whole has recruiting events of which we in Computer Science are a part, which is why you may receive two different letters.  The Computer Science undergraduate programs page has helpful information. here is a great variety of research being done, including network security, intelligent tutoring systems, and uses of technology in education. Many open house sessions include a lab tour of the Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL), which has samples of its work on the EVLTube youtube channel.   Department of Computer Science  851 S.

Laine Higgins\u00a0 Wall Street Journal A team of researchers at the Center on Depression and Resilience at the University of Illinois at Chicago is working on technology that could monitor users\u2019 mood and cognition\u2014important indicators of mental-health stress\u2014by tracking their typing patterns with an iPhone app called BiAffect. Initial research has found it is possible to predict episodes of mania and depression among users with bipolar and major depressive disorder based on changes in their typing habits. For instance, a manic episode may be preceded by rising numbers of typos, faster typing, more frequent use of the \u201cdelete\u201d key or tremors detected by the phone\u2019s accelerometer, which measures the device\u2019s tilting and orientation. During depressive episodes, users withdraw from their personal technology and tend to send short, infrequent messages. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t track what you type, but how you type it,\u201d says Dr. Alex Leow, an associate professor from the university\u2019s College of Medicine and lead researcher on the project. \u2018\u00a0Rather than waiting until the patient shows up in somebody\u2019s office for intervention, you could do the intervention in real time through the same device that\u2019s monitoring their symptoms.\u00a0\u2019 \u2014Dr. Olusola Ajilore, an associate professor of psychiatry on the BiAffect team The BiAffect study is part of a larger trend in psychology of attempting to measure how the brain functions using \u201cdigital exhaust\u201d from users\u2019 daily interactions with technology. There are over 10,000 mental-health-related apps on the App Store, according to the National Institute of Mental Health\u2019s most recent count. The trouble is that evidence-backed apps like BiAffect that can substantiate their claims of effectiveness make up just 3% of that total, says Dr. Adam Haim, an NIMH expert on mental-health apps. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of promise,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of false promise out there as well.\u201d The NIMH considers the development of digitally delivered interventions a priority because they have the potential to make treatment available to more people, decrease medication switch rates,\u00a0reduce hospitalizations and perhaps lower medical costs in the long run. However, apps like BiAffect that passively collect data come with a host of ethical concerns, mostly related to privacy. False positives can have costly consequences for users if an app fails to properly de-identify data or is not compliant with federal health-data protection standards, says Dr. Haim. People \u201cneed to understand the potential implications of opening themselves to the release of data to a third party,\u201d he says. BiAffect\u2019s aim is to be \u201cas unobtrusive as possible,\u201d says Dr. Leow. After downloading the app, users opt into the study and allow the specially coded BiAffect keyboard to replace their iPhone\u2019s default version. The app then operates behind the scenes whenever a person uses their phone, compiling a trove of objective data. The goal with this approach, the researchers say, is to make an unbiased real-time assessment of users\u2019 mental state in their natural environments. Typical mental-health assessments are made by polling patients on their state of mind through questionnaires or in-person meetings in clinical settings, and they are prone to self-reporting bias and other collection flaws. Researchers made BiAffect available to the general public on the App Store in March and it has since yielded over 8,150 hours of data from more than 1,300 users. The app was created as part of the Mood Challenge, a contest funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that challenged researchers to find new ways to use Apple Inc.\u2019s open-source app development platform, ResearchKit, to study mood disorders. BiAffect\u2019s creators intentionally didn\u2019t limit the app for use in clinical settings, though they believe it could be most effective when used by mental-health professionals to monitor their patients. Such use is probably several years off, said Dr. Olusola Ajilore, an associate professor of psychiatry on the BiAffect team. But researchers hope the app will eventually allow clinicians to offer just-in-time interventions. \u201cRather than waiting until the patient shows up in somebody\u2019s office for intervention, you could do the intervention in real time through the same device that\u2019s monitoring their symptoms,\u201d he says.

The other UIC participants are\u00a0Computer Science Research Associate Professor Luc Renambot, Senior Research Programmer Lance Long, and Associate Professor Andy Johnson, Research Director of the EVL. This new funding is part of a $527,000 supplement to\u00a0the overall SAGE2 software project, with PI Jason Leigh at University of Hawaii. The supplement brings\u00a0the overall project funding to roughly $5.5 million,\u00a0with roughly 20% at University of Hawaii and 80% at UIC. The overall project is for the SAGE2 software\u00a0that allows groups to collaborate on large, multi-screen devices such as EVL\u2019s CAVE2. This new supplement is for the research team to consider the cybersecurity of SAGE2, in\u00a0this era when cybersecurity is of such paramount importance. \u201cSI2-SSI: SAGEnext: Next Generation Integrated Persistent Visualization and Collaboration Services for Global Cyberinfrastructure\u201d \u00a0 \u2013 ABSTRACT \u2013 Cyberinfrastructure runs the gamut \u2013 from computing, networks, data stores, instruments, observatories, and sensors, to software and application codes \u2013 and promises to enable research at unprecedented scales, complexity, resolution, and accuracy. However, it is the research community that must make sense of all the data being amassed, so the SAGEnext (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) framework is an innovative user-centered platform that connects people to their data and colleagues, locally and remotely, via tiled display walls, creating a portal, or wide-aperture \u201cdigital lens,\u201d with which to view their data and one another. It enables Cyber-Mashups, or the ability to juxtapose and integrate information from multiple sources in a variety of resolutions, as easily as the Web makes access to lower-resolution images today.\u00a0 . . .

At one end of the spectrum, computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation.  At the other end of the spectrum, computer science may be seen as the application of human resources, software and of course, computers to solve computational problems relating to society's and individuals' needs. A well-trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum--and several points in between.  The Computer Science curriculum in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background.  Along with a strong theoretical component, our program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design, implementation and validation of computer systems.  In our experience, industry and graduate programs alike value--above all--people who can solve real problems, and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade. All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science: computer systems, organization and architecture, algorithms and data structures, principles of software design, elements of the theory of computation, and operating systems.  In addition, students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in Computer Science.  Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics, along with additional courses in writing, humanities, social sciences and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers. There are very few areas in modern society untouched by Computer Science.  Computer science is present in everything from health care, telecommunications and entertainment, to transportation, education and defense. The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field.  In support of this, the Computer Science program provides its students with a well-rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science, placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills. Student Affairs Calendar Undergraduate Admissions  Student Graduation Objectives Frequently Asked Questions The Computer Systems Concentration represents a sub-specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware.  The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science: programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture and operating systems.  Unlike traditional computer science, however, the student also studies low-level circuit analysis and high-level system design, and has the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses.  The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering. The Software Engineering Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science, including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems.  In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of software engineering practice such as software cost estimation, large-scale software development, and risk management. The Human-Centered Computing Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in areas such as: user-interface design and development for desktop or mobile devices; computer graphics and animation for video games, movie special effects; and scientific-, engineering- and medical visualization.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems. In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of human-centered computing practice such as user-interface design, computer graphics, visual media, and natural language processing.

We describe an approach that overcomes the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of web applications. Our approach combines dynamic analysis that is guided by static analysis techniques in order to automatically identify vulnerabilities and build working exploits. Our approach is implemented and evaluated in NAVEX, a tool that can scale the process of automatic vulnerability analysis and exploit generation to large applications and to multiple classes of vulnerabilities. In our experiments, we were able to use NAVEX over a codebase of 3.2 million lines of PHP code, and construct 204 exploits in the code that was analyzed. \u00a0 Creating an online buzz . . .

However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to engage patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient\u2019s level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective.

The two-day event kicked off on Friday evening as participants heard from both industry professionals and fellow hackers who described potential problems teams could tackle throughout the weekend. The UIC team, who went by the name \u201cPoliThinkers,\u201d was made up of ECE students Michele Calvi and Andrea Ciccardi; CS students Giovanni Agugini Bassi, Iacopo Olivo, Francesco Pinci, and BioEngineering alumna Chiara Gatti. The team are all part of UIC\u2019s master\u2019s degree contract programs between the College of Engineering and Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico di Milano. They competed against seven other teams of hackers and coders as they worked to create the best solution to some of the BuiltWorld\u2019s problems. \u201cThe hackathon was about innovating the construction world and, speaking with people, we found out that security was one of the most important concerns,\u201d said Ciccardi. \u201cFor this reason, we tried to think about a solution that applied our knowledges to that world and\u00a0the idea of wearable connected devices came out from the brainstorming session.\u201d The UIC team developed an interactive system to prevent accidents by warning the workers that are going to be in dangerous situations and remind them about safety procedures while utilizing a certain kind of machinery that implies a safety protocol to be respected. The system is able to read vitals from people to warn others when an accident occurs in order to speed up the emergency operations faster and eliminate unnecessary steps in the protocol. Even with a solid idea, the team still ran into additional two big obstacles during the event. \u201cWhen we found out that our idea was similar to one already in the market. We wrote to one of the judges and she suggested to us to focus on what we had that was more than what already existed.\u201d She and other people at the event helped us a lot since they were really interested in the idea,\u201d said Ciccardi. \u201cThe second was to develop the real demo for the event. Our solution is a connected wearable device system, but, not having any bracelet with sensors to use, we managed to make everything with an android cellphone. The guys who developed the demo didn\u2019t sleep much that night, but they did a great work to arrive on Sunday afternoon with a working demo to show some of the use cases of our device.\u201d Apart from developing the idea, the team also had to present it to a panel of judges. This is an area where the UIC team set themselves apart from the competition. According to the judges, UIC\u2019s presentation was much more thorough than some of the other teams. The team considered stakeholders, reviewed statistics from OSHA, and really applied the information to their presentation. \u201cWhen we realized we won we were pretty incredulous,\u201d said Ciccardi.

Ubicomp is an annual global conference focused on research in pervasive and ubiquitous computing. Sakhini received Honorable Mention (Top 3 out of 200!) for her poster presentation of her project myCityMeter, a device that detects noise and air pollution, which has shown to produce mild cognitive impairment in older adults who experience long-term exposure. She discovered this problem while researching epidemiological studies with her advisor Professor\u00a0Debeleena Chattopadhyay\u00a0in the HCI Lab at UIC. \u201cDuring the presentation, I was happy with how people thought that it is a great project and good work,\u201d Sakhnini said. \u201cI loved seeing the excitement in the eyes of my audience as I introduced them to myCityMeter and walked them through the project. Most importantly, I loved how people gave me feedback and ideas about the project.\u201d Nina also participated in a Broadening Participation workshop where she connected with students and researchers from around the world. \u201cWe had discussions about the different problems people from around the world go through as researchers. A significant thing I learned from this workshop is \u2018research-life\u2019 skills,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cThese are non-technical skills that could help me to\u00a0sustain a successful research career. My favorite takeaway was \u201cbe stubborn and persistent.\u201d Nina plans on expanding her research on myCity Meter. \u201cWe are working on replacing the handheld sensing module with a wearable. We are also working on improving the quality of the low-cost sensor readings by constructing algorithms for calibration based on different attenuation and distortion factors. Also, we are working on replacing the cognitive test with an avatar-based interface that will evaluate the cognitive performance,\u201d she said. Although Nina is completing her Masters this spring, she plans on continuing her research and expanding on myCityMeter by pursuing her PhD in Computer Science. \u201cOnce I was excluded from an internship application because I am a woman. I was told that men become scientists and engineers, and I, as a woman, don\u2019t fit among them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was when I decided I wanted to be both! I want to be in a leading position- the academic professor: to contribute in the process of creating generations of engineers and scientists and to empower those who might be oppressed otherwise, the scientist in engineering: to contribute to bettering the world by adding to the body of science and engineering.\u201d    Notice:  get_currentuserinfo is deprecated since version 4.5.0!

Each student was awarded $1,000 and a 3-month membership to Connectory in Chicago. (Left to right:\u00a0Riccardo Pressiani, Guido Muscioni, Matteo Foglio, Lorenzo Norcini, Claudio Montanari) Five MS Computer Science students won the top prize at Mobility Hackathon Chicago on October 20-21, sponsored by Bosch and KPMG.\u00a0 Their winning platform and device Feel Your City can collect, visualize and analyze data about air quality and noise pollution in cities. The idea is to put the sensor on public transportation vehicles, such as bikes, buses and trains. The five students who are part of a contract degree program with Politecnico di Milano in Italy each won $1,000 and a 3-month membership to the event host Chicago Connectory,\u00a0an IoT incubator located in the Merchandise Mart. The team had 26 continuous hours to come up with an idea and create a working prototype which proved to be a challenging task for the team. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Riccardo Pressiani (MS \u201919). \u201cWe started to think about how we move around Chicago. We\u2019re students so we use the CTA every day to commute to UIC and back home. The breakthrough happened when we put our skills on the table and what came out was sensors, IoT, cloud platform, data analytics, machine learning and data visualization. Putting everything together we came up with Feel Your City.\u201d The team created machine learning algorithms to extract useful information in real-time that can be provided to city officials to help improve the public experience when moving around the city. Riccardo Pressiani (MS, \u201919) presents Feel Your City device and platform at Mobility Hackathon Chicago on October 21st. A Divvy bike fabricated with the Feel Your City device which detects noise and air pollution. \u201cThe most exciting thing about this project is the chance to actually use our skill to do something good for the city. It was a great feeling to see how we could build something useful in such a short amount of time doing what we do every day,\u201d Pressiani said. This was not the team\u2019s first hackathon, but it was their first top prize, beating out 11 other teams. \u201cWe were the only team to actually physically build something during the event, so we were hoping to get at least one of the prizes. For sure, we didn\u2019t expect to see such an appreciation for our work from the judges.\u201d This is only the beginning for Feel Your City. \u201cWe would like to continue to work on this project and work with the people we met at the hackathon to go through our idea and understand if and what needs to be adjusted to make it an actual viable product,\u201d Pressiani said. Putting the victory aside, Pressiani is a big advocate for students attending hackathons. \u201cWe strongly suggest to all our mates to try to join one of these events. There are a ton of events like the one we did. Try to find the one that best match your skills and just do it. Even if you don\u2019t win, these events open you a lot of opportunities thanks to the networking that you can do,\u201d he said.    Notice:  get_currentuserinfo is deprecated since version 4.5.0!

Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston More than 60 Computer Science students, faculty and staff attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston September 26-28.\u00a0 Students were able to attend presentations on a variety of topics, professional development activities, an open source day, and much more during what is billed as the world\u2019s largest gathering of women technologists. \u201cSeeing so many girls from the technological field was actually a motivator and relief because we don\u2019t see much of that on campus. The few days spent there was both educational and so inspiring.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Aiswarya Baiju (BS \u201919) CS student Aiswarya Baiju presents her research at Grace Hopper  Aiswary Baiju (BS \u201919) was one of several Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) attendees selected for a technical poster presentation of her research\u00a0on the development of an automated virtual health coaching assistant. \u201cI have always been intrigued by Artificial Intelligence and the research project my professor was working on was very interesting and it\u2019s a technology that doesn\u2019t exist yet. So I knew I wanted to be part of such a project that will expose me to new ideas and help me learn more and put my technical skills to test,\u201d Baiju said. Baiju felt her poster made a good impression on the GHC attendees. \u201cThey were quite fascinated by the project we were working on and wanted to know much more about it and the future steps we will be working on for automation and the system. Some have even decided to follow-up with me after the conference to further discuss about the research and to know more about the previous progress.\u201d Baiju enjoyed her GHC experience. \u201cIt was a very enlightening and quite an eye-opening moment for me; it boosted my confidence in both my technical as well as professional skills. Seeing all these women excel in their field and receiving valuable feedback from them and just being around such accomplished individuals who had so much knowledge and advice to share with us, it was just incredible.\u201d Baiju\u2019s advice for other female computer science students: \u201cI would encourage more people to apply and attend GHC because every second we spent there was so worth it and so inspirational. It\u2019s an experience that we don\u2019t get much of and is worth taking advantage of,\u201d she said.    Notice:  get_currentuserinfo is deprecated since version 4.5.0!

The presence of tobacco products at UIC poses a health risk for everyone on campus.  UIC has prohibited smoking indoors and near building entryways since 1995. The Tobacco-Free\n    Campus Policy went into effect January 1, 2014. This policy was expanded the followinging year to\n    comply with the Smoke-Free Campus Act (110 ILCS 64/1-99) which required all campuses in\n    Illinois to institute disciplinary action, fines, and an appeals process for violation of this\n    policy. The Tobacco-Free Campus Policy applies to all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to\n    cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes (hookahs), chew, electronic cigarettes, and smokeless\n    tobacco products. \u00a0 \u00a0 Beginning July 1, 2015, the State of Illinois mandated that smoking be prohibited on\n        every campus of a state-supported institution of higher education. This applies to each\n        campus, including buildings, grounds, parking lots, and vehicles owned and operated by\n        universities; employees; guests; and students. Each state-supported institution of higher education has the authority to implement the \n        act accordingly and authorize and distribute all policies and regulations necessary for \n        this purpose. This may include, but is not limited to, citations, fines, and disciplinary \n        action. \u00a0 \u00a0 In compliance with the State of Illinois Smoke-Free Campus Act, 110 ILCS \n    64/1-99, additional \"no smoking\" signs have been posted around campus and all ashtrays have been \n    removed from university property. The UIC campus has instituted a system of citations and\n    fines. The UIC Police Department now has the authority to issue citations and related fines\n    for violations of the Tobacco-Free Campus policy. Individuals who observe someone smoking in a location prohibited by our policy should \n        contact the UIC Police at the non-emergency number, 312.996.2830. Violations must be \n        reported at the time they occur. Staff and faculty violators will be reported to UIC Human\n        Resources and/or Faculty Affairs. Students in violation of the policy will be reported\n        directly to the Dean of Student Affairs. Repeated violations by an individual may lead to\n        disciplinary action. \u00a0 \u00a0 By eliminating second-hand smoke, the Chicago campus underscores its commitment to providing\n     a healthy learning environment for students and a healthy work environment for faculty and \n     staff. The campus\u2019 new policy supports and builds upon the state\u2019s Smoke-Free Illinois Act (410 ILC \n    82/) and complies with the Smoke-Free Campus Act (110 ILCS 64/1-99), which required all \n    Illinois campuses to become smoke free as of July 1, 2015. The Smoke-Free Campus Policy went into effect January 1, 2014 for the Chicago campus.  On \t\n    July 1, 2015 this policy was expanded to comply with the Smoke-Free Campus Act (110 ILCS \n    64/1-99) which required all campuses in Illinois to institute disciplinary action, fines, and \n    an appeals process. No. Smoking is prohibited on all campus property. Those choosing to smoke must do so at \n    least 15 feet from any property owned or controlled by the campus. Please consult the \n    Smoke-Free Campus map at maps.uic.edu for more information about campus boundaries.\n\t All events occurring on campus property are covered by the smoke-free policy. Yes, you are allowed to smoke in your private vehicles. Smoking in university vehicles has been prohibited for several years and remains so under this policy. If you received your citation for a third violation of the Smoke-Free Campus policy, you have the option of either paying the fine according to the instructions on the front of the citation or completing UIC's Nicotine 101 course here. This online course must be completed within 72 hours of the issuance of the citation. \nStudent citations may also be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students for disciplinary action through the student conduct process. Students will be notified upon receipt of this smoking citation. Outcomes rendered in the student conduct process are independent of the prescribed consequences listed in this citation. \nStaff and faculty citations may be referred to UIC Human Resources for disciplinary action. Staff/faculty will be notified upon receipt of this smoking citation. All student appeals must go through the Dean of Students Office by going to dos.uic.edu and all faculty/staff appeals must go through Human Resources by going to www.hr.uic.edu Appeals must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the violation date and the citation must be paid in full before you may file an official appeal. An appeals board made up of faculty, staff and students will review appeals and other relevant information in making a determination. The appeals board will notify the appellant of their decision within 10 business days.\n \u00a0 \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago \nPolice Department\n943 West Maxwell Street\t\nRm. 210 (M/C 278)\nChicago, Illinois  60608\n(312) 996-2830\t\n \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\nUIC Human Resources\n715 S.

To determine which courses are being offered, students should consult the Schedule of Classes through my.UIC before registration begins. The Archive and Links section lists links to archived versions of catalogs and additional documents and websites that are useful in the academic planning process. The commitment of the University of Illinois to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity requires that decisions involving students and employees be based on individual merit and be free from invidious discrimination in all its forms. The University of Illinois will not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations. The nondiscrimination policy applies to admissions, employment, access to and treatment in the University programs and activities. University complaint and grievance procedures provide employees and students with the means for the resolution of complaints that allege a violation of this Statement. Members of the public should direct their inquiries or complaints to the appropriate equal opportunity office.\nPolicy Council Revised May 31, 2005 Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of University life.

Notification will also be posted to the\u00a0UIC.edu\u00a0homepage and on the UIC Facebook and Twitter accounts. We continually monitor weather and road conditions throughout the area. During snow and ice storms we work diligently to keep the Chicago campus open and accessible.\u00a0 This involves work around the clock to clear the building entrances, streets, sidewalks and parking lots. Priority for snow and ice removal is always given to the hospital and ambulatory care areas, ADA entrances and parking spaces for persons with disabilities, emergency routes, and public walkways. Temporary closures of some parking lots and the top decks of parking structures may be required to allow snow and ice to be safely removed.\u00a0 We may ticket or tow vehicles that disregard these closures.\u00a0 Depending on weather conditions \u2014 a heavy snow, blowing wind, ice, and the timing of the storm \u2014 it may take a few days to completely clear the campus and trash removal and recycling pickups may be delayed. Use the 24/7 phone number, 5-SNOW (312-355-7669) to report any snow- or ice-related problems on campus. Please provide the following information: location, time, and a phone number or e-mail address for follow-up, if desired.

The University of Illinois at Chicago and the State of Illinois offer competitive wages, benefit programs and resources for employees. UIC is strongly committed to providing equitable benefit options throughout each stage of employment. Many benefits become effective on the first day of employment. Benefits offered by UIC include health care options, wellness programs, educational opportunities, tuition assistance, vacations, holidays and other leave benefits, and University retirement plans. Detailed information on specific employee benefits may be found in subsequent sections or on the NESSIE website. Benefit Overview Orientation sessions are held on all campuses. Sessions are designed to provide comprehensive materials and information to new benefit-eligible employees. Benefit selection must be completed within the first 30 calendar days of employment. Please see the Benefits Overview Guide (PDF) for information and assistance. The University of Illinois at Chicago provides benefits to employees to enhance their work experience and economic security. Some of these benefits include, but are not limited to: Benefits are subject to change at any time. State of Illinois benefits are provided by the Group Insurance Act of 1971, which gives the State's Department of Central Management Services (CMS) the authority and responsibility to design, administer, negotiate and/or contract for benefits. Any change in these benefits is decided upon by CMS and becomes effective for all State of Illinois employees. Benefits include: The University of Illinois at Chicago also offers optional supplemental benefits. University of Illinois at Chicago benefits are approved by the Board of Trustees and managed by the University. Benefits include: In addition to the State and University benefits, eligible employees are required to participate in benefits offered through the State Universities Retirement System (SURS). Benefits include: Each year the University of Illinois at Chicago holds an open enrollment period, typically during the month of May, called Benefit Choice. Any change in State or University benefits is implemented at this time and becomes effective the following July 1. Changes to benefits plans can typically be made only during Benefit Choice or when experiencing a qualifying event. Some plans allow enrollments and changes at any time of the year. Employee benefits eligibility is determined by several factors, including full or part-time status as well as appointment /classification type (Civil Service, Academic Professional, faculty etc.), job, and in cases of some foreign national employees, tax status. General Benefits Eligibility Employees newly eligible for benefits have 30 calendar days from their hire date or eligibility date to make State Insurance plan elections, including declining insurance coverage.

It is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a contract. Faculty assignments and programs listed are subject to change. Courses are not necessarily offered each term or each year. Individual departments or units should be consulted for current information regarding programs, faculty, and regularity of course offerings. The online catalog is updated as degree programs, courses, and requirements change. The catalog is an academic planning tool for graduate students and is divided into five major sections. In addition, the catalog provides a listing of the graduate faculty and links to the Graduate College website and catalog archive. Each section of the online catalog, described below, provides information necessary for the academic planning process. The University section provides an overview of the University of Illinois at Chicago. The Graduate Study at UIC section outlines admissions, application, degree requirement, and university information pertinent to all Graduate College students. The Degree Programs section lists all graduate and professional degree programs and certificate programs available at UIC. It also provides a list of program updates and changes. The Colleges & Schools section describes graduate degree programs and their requirements in detail. Students use this section of the catalog to ensure that they understand and meet all requirements for their degree program. The Graduate Course Descriptions section lists all the graduate courses at UIC. The course descriptions are arranged alphabetically by subject area. Each course description includes a rubric (subject area abbreviation), course number, course title, semester hours, prerequisites (if any), and course content.

The University of Illinois will not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations. The nondiscrimination policy applies to admissions, employment, access to and treatment in the University programs and activities. University complaint and grievance procedures provide employees and students with the means for the resolution of complaints that allege a violation of this Statement. Members of the public should direct their inquiries or complaints to the appropriate equal opportunity office.

Latinos que son expuestos a los pesticidas en sus lugares de trabajo tienen el doble la probabilidad de tener enfermedades cardiovasculares en comparaci\u00f3n a Latinos que no est\u00e1n expuestos a pesticidas en el trabajo, seg\u00fan un nuevo estudio publicado en la revista \u201cHeart\u201d. El estudio analiz\u00f3 \u00a0las respuestas de un cuestionario de 7.404 empleados Latinos \u00a0de 18 a 74 a\u00f1os de edad matriculados en la Comunidad Hispana Estudio de Salud/Estudio de Latinos (HCHS/SOL \u00a0por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s ) con respecto a la exposici\u00f3n ocupacional a pesticidas, metales y solventes\u2013 sustancias conocidos por tener un impacto negativo en la salud cardiovascular. El HCHS/SOL es el estudio epidemiol\u00f3gico m\u00e1s grande de Hispanos/Latinos e incluye a m\u00e1s de 16.000 participantes de San Diego, Miami, Chicago y el Bronx en Nueva York. Los participantes se les preguntaron si hab\u00edan sido expuestos a metales, solventes o pesticidas en el trabajo. \u201cEstudios recientes han relacionado ciertos qu\u00edmicos encontrados en solventes y pesticidas y polvos met\u00e1licos a las enfermedades cardiovasculares, pero ninguno de esos estudios espec\u00edficamente examin\u00f3 a los Hispanos/Latinos\u2013un grupo especialmente vulnerable a la exposici\u00f3n a las toxinas en el trabajo\u201d, dijo Mar\u00eda Argos, profesora asociada de epidemiolog\u00eda y bioestad\u00edsticas en la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago (UIC) en la Escuela de Salud P\u00fablica y autor del estudio. In English. Cerca de 5 a 9 por ciento de los trabajadores Latinos reportaron exposici\u00f3n a solventes, metales o pesticidas en sus lugares de trabajo. \u201cAunque nuestro estudio no involucr\u00f3 medidas objetivas para la exposici\u00f3n de qu\u00edmicos t\u00f3xicos o metales en muestras de sangre u orina, se observ\u00f3 enfermedad cardiovascular significativamente mayor, m\u00e1s fuertemente para la fibrilaci\u00f3n auricular, entre aquellos que reportaron exposici\u00f3n ocupacional a pesticidas\u201d, dijo Argos. Los investigadores encontraron que participantes reportando exposici\u00f3n ocupacional a los pesticidas ten\u00edan el doble de probabilidad de tener alg\u00fan tipo de enfermedad cardiovascular en comparaci\u00f3n con aquellos que no reportaron exposici\u00f3n a los pesticidas. Participantes reportando la exposici\u00f3n a los pesticidas en el trabajo ten\u00edan el doble de probabilidad de tener enfermedad coronaria, un tipo de enfermedad cardiovascular donde se acumulan placas de colesterol en las paredes de las arterias, causando rigidez y aumentando el riesgo de co\u00e1gulos sangu\u00edneos y embolia. Cuando los investigadores analizaron espec\u00edficamente la fibrilaci\u00f3n auricular\u2013 un tipo de enfermedad cardiovascular caracterizada por un ritmo card\u00edaco irregular y r\u00e1pido que puede causar flujo sangu\u00edneo deficiente \u2014 descubrieron que los participantes que reportaron exposici\u00f3n laboral a metales eran casi cuatro veces m\u00e1s probable de tener la enfermedad y aquellos que reportaron exposici\u00f3n ocupacional a plaguicidas ten\u00edan m\u00e1s de cinco veces m\u00e1s probabilidad de tener la enfermedad en comparaci\u00f3n con los participantes que no presentaron con estas exposiciones en el trabajo. \u201cNuestros resultados sugieren fuertemente que preguntarles a pacientes sobre su historia ocupacional puede ayudar a los m\u00e9dicos descubrir la exposici\u00f3n a productos qu\u00edmicos t\u00f3xicos o metales que puedan contribuir a la enfermedad cardiovascular,\u201d dijo la Doctora Martha Daviglus, profesora\u00a0 de medicina Edmund F. Foley en el Colegio de Medicina de la UIC, directora del Instituto para la Investigaci\u00f3n de Salud de Minor\u00edas e investigador principal de \u00a0HCHS/SOL en Chicago. \u201cSabemos que la exposici\u00f3n a las toxinas y los metales es perjudicial para la salud, y nuestro estudio confirma los efectos da\u00f1inos en la salud cardiovascular. As\u00ed, deben tomarse esfuerzos para reducir la exposici\u00f3n a estas sustancias siempre que sea posible\u201d.

UIC\u00a0prides itself on providing students with access to academic excellence and opportunity in an exciting urban environment. We are Chicago\u2019s only public research university, and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse college campuses\u00a0in the country, with over 31,000 students, 15 colleges, a hospital and a health sciences system. As UIC\u2019s chief academic officer, I am responsible for the planning, execution, and assessment of UIC\u2019s academic programs so that our students are prepared to pursue their chosen paths in life and to be productive and contributing members of their communities. I am dedicated to the support and retention of our outstanding faculty, and to the recruitment of the next generation of scholars and researchers. This office, along with the leadership team at UIC is deeply engaged in facilitating the implementation of the strategic priorities identified by the Chancellor and supported through an extensive process of faculty governance. These priorities are: This website contains resources about academic policies and opportunities at UIC. The academic mission is further supported and implemented by the Vice Provosts.\u00a0 Contact the Office of the Provost or email Associate Provost and Chief of Staff, Aisha El-Amin at aelami2@uic.edu\u00a0with any questions or concerns. The board of trustees of both the University of Illinois and The John Marshall Law School have voted to create UIC John Marshall Law School, which will become Chicago\u2019s only public law school. In addition to providing current and prospective students with a more affordable legal education, UIC\u2019s acquisition of John Marshall will create opportunities for interdisciplinary courses and new joint and dual-degree programs aligned with UIC strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and business.

Building a strong network of professional contacts now will help you throughout your career! Networking is simply a word to describe connecting with people in your chosen professional field. It\u2019s a process of developing professional relationships that will help you grow your career. You probably network regularly without realizing it (e.g. speaking with professors about your career goals, meeting a recruiter at a career fair and following up with a LinkedIn connection request, or asking a friend\u2019s parent who\u2019s also an engineer about how they got into engineering). Believe it or not, as many as 80% of new jobs are never posted online; they\u2019re obtained through networking. That means that a majority of your job searching time should be spent networking. Not at all! Most working professionals have obtained at least one job or internship through networking. Engineers and other professionals have been in your shoes before, and some will be happy to help you. Not everyone will be receptive or have time to give you advice, so, if one person can\u2019t provide the information you want, move on to someone else. Your network is a lot bigger than you think. Anybody you have ever met is part of your network. \u00a0Family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, professors, and classmates. People who interview you are part of your network. Even some people you have never met are part of your network, including UIC alumni. The amount of networking opportunities available to you are only limited by your willingness and ability to simply talk to people. You can network at real-time events (including career fairs, trade shows, networking-focused happy hour events, student org meetings, Career Center employer events) or virtually over email and LinkedIn. Check out events both on- and off-campus to talk to people who are working in your desired field(s). For networking virtually through email or LinkedIn: \u00a0 Sample Message sent through a LinkedIn connection request: Hi {NAME}, I\u2019m an engineering student at UIC thinking about my overall career path. I\u2019m interested in {INDUSTRY} and want to network with professionals in your field. I saw that you went to UIC for engineering as well!

When individuals experience acts of sexual misconduct (i.e. sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence), their sense of safety and trust is violated and this can significantly interfere with their success at the university. Our community expects that all interpersonal relationships and interactions \u2013 especially those of an intimate nature \u2013 are based upon values of mutual respect, dignity, responsibility, open communication, and clear consent. Responding to incidents of sexual misconduct can be challenging, whether you are the person harmed or someone trying to help. We share the responsibility for creating a safer, more caring campus culture in which bias, harassment, and violence have no place\u2014and every member of our community is free to flourish. The\u00a0Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy\u00a0has been developed to address all types of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, dating violence and domestic violence. The university takes all complaints and accusations of sexual misconduct seriously. We welcome your involvement in our mission to foster a campus environment that strives to prevent sexual misconduct and promotes the reporting of sexual misconduct, compassionate responses to survivors of sexual violence, and equitable treatment of student complainants and respondents. The UIC Sexual Misconduct website serves as a comprehensive resource for students, faculty, and staff. The site includes information about the UIC Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy and procedures, helpful resources, and the university\u2019s prevention and training programs. Please look through this site to access critical information you may need such as: how to report an incident of sexual misconduct; how to get help; how to help someone who has been sexually assaulted; campus and community resources; and information about student rights and confidentiality. The website was created by the members of the Student Response Team which include representatives from the Office of the Dean of Students, UIC Police, Office for Access and Equity, University Counsel, Campus Advocacy Network, Counseling Center, Campus Housing, Wellness Center, Office of International Services, Campus Programs, Campus Auxiliary Services, and Public Affairs. Contact the Title IX Coordinator in the Office for Access and Equity for information regarding Title IX and the reporting of sexual misconduct.\nLocation: 809 S.

UIC\u00a0prides itself on providing students with access to academic excellence and opportunity in an exciting urban environment. We are Chicago\u2019s only public research university, and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse college campuses\u00a0in the country, with over 31,000 students, 15 colleges, a hospital and a health sciences system. As UIC\u2019s chief academic officer, I am responsible for the planning, execution, and assessment of UIC\u2019s academic programs so that our students are prepared to pursue their chosen paths in life and to be productive and contributing members of their communities. I am dedicated to the support and retention of our outstanding faculty, and to the recruitment of the next generation of scholars and researchers. This office, along with the leadership team at UIC is deeply engaged in facilitating the implementation of the strategic priorities identified by the Chancellor and supported through an extensive process of faculty governance. These priorities are: This website contains resources about academic policies and opportunities at UIC. The academic mission is further supported and implemented by the Vice Provosts.\u00a0 Contact the Office of the Provost or email Associate Provost and Chief of Staff, Aisha El-Amin at aelami2@uic.edu\u00a0with any questions or concerns. The board of trustees of both the University of Illinois and The John Marshall Law School have voted to create UIC John Marshall Law School, which will become Chicago\u2019s only public law school. In addition to providing current and prospective students with a more affordable legal education, UIC\u2019s acquisition of John Marshall will create opportunities for interdisciplinary courses and new joint and dual-degree programs aligned with UIC strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and business.

Recycling is required by Illinois Law and is one of the easiest ways you can help the university be a good environmental steward. We must\u00a0reduce the waste we produce by choosing materials wisely; reuse what we have already by considering new roles for unwanted material; and recycle what must be thrown away, thus minimizing material bound for the landfill and increase our landfill diversion rate to 90%! Here you will find what and where you can recycle on campus, more sustainable alternatives, and information about zero waste events. This recycling tutorial will walk you through the steps of what and how to recycle at UIC in less than 5 minutes. Recycling stations of different shapes and sizes can be found in the hallways in every building at UIC and should be no more than a few steps away from your office, classroom or lab. These stations usually consist of three bins (\u201cPaper\u201d; \u201cBottles & Cans\u201d; and \u201cLandfill\u201d). You can recycle paper, broken-down cardboard, empty containers of glass and metal, and all plastics with a number except #6 PS (polystyrene). Buildings with laboratories also have collections for pipette tip boxes, which are #5 PP (polypropylene) plastic. Certain buildings on campus also have collection bins for batteries, writing utensils, and plastic bags (and other plastic \u201cfilm\u201d). \u00a0 If you work in an office, you should have a small, blue or grey bin for paper recycling and an even smaller black or grey bin for landfill material. You can empty the blue, desk-side recycling bin it into the larger hallway or common area bins whenever it is convenient for you. A Building Service Worker (BSW) will come through to empty the hallway bins. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see the BSW place all bags into one cart \u2013 they will separate the bags into the proper containers in the dock area of your building. If you need assistance obtaining recycling bins for your office contact us at the link at the bottom of the page. The Great Stuff Exchange (GSX) is an office supplies giveaway program. UIC collects items like binders, desk top filing systems, and other office supplies form departments that can no longer use them and makes them available for students, staff and faculty \u2013 for free! All donated items must be in clean and working condition. Each September, there is a centralized collection event for university-owned electronics. Simply fill out the appropriate paperwork, bring your items and a copy of the FABWEB disposal request, and we will make sure it is recycled properly in accordance with the Illinois\u00a0Electronic Products Recycling and Reuse Act and the OBFS Equipment Disposal Methods. UIC accepts donations of unwanted \u2013 but working \u2013 laboratory materials especially glass flasks and beakers, and plastic pipettes and centrifuge tubes. The LabShare program also accepts equipment without university property tags (\u201cP-Tags\u201d). Researchers may request these items for use in the lab. A Zero Waste event doesn\u2019t have to be that hard!\u00a0One of the most critical things in zero waste planning is assuring that 90% of your event\u2019s waste is diverted from landfill. This means reusable, compostable, or recyclable materials are used when needed, You are also participating in resource recovery for donating untouched, packaged items. Carefully differentiating between each material and recognizing the exact materials used may seem like a lot of work, however, we are here to help you through your zero-waste event planning. The UIC Zero Waste Planning Guide includes a case study for an example, definitions, a list of operations to be done before, during, and after your event, and a list of sustainable resources. With careful, thought-out planning, zero waste is easy and sustainable! It all starts with smart materials. It begins when the materials available for use on campus are chosen based on\u00a0compatibility within our recycling program. If an item (for example, Styrofoam cups) is provided for use on campus, it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to ask why it was chosen in the first place. Choosing materials with more recycled content helps the economy and the environment. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site 90%  1140 S.

Chicago has received a $1.1 million, five-year grant from NASA\u2019s Astrobiology Institute to identify biosignatures of life on Titan \u2014 Saturn\u2019s largest moon \u2014 from either currently living or long-extinct life. Titan\u2019s ocean, which sits below a thick ice layer, is believed to have conditions favorable to life. The project, led by researchers in UIC\u2019s department of earth and environmental sciences, is one of several national research initiatives focused on answering key questions related to the astrobiology of our solar system: what do other habitable environments look like, what kinds of organisms might have lived in these environments, and what biosignatures \u2014 chemical or molecular \u201cfossils\u201d indicative of current or previous life \u2014 should we look for? A schematic drawing shows where life could have evolved on Titan. (Image: Athanasios Karagiotas and Theoni Shalamberidze) Until the NASA Cassini mission \u2014 which in 2005 sent a small spacecraft on several data-collecting flybys of Titan before it landed on the moon\u2019s surface, where it collected and transmitted data back to Earth \u2014 little was known about Titan except that it had a hazy, nitrogen-rich atmosphere. Cassini revealed that Titan has seas of liquid methane and ethane, replenished by rain from hydrocarbon clouds. The mission also provided evidence that Titan has an ocean made up of water beneath a global water ice sheet that is estimated to be as much as 80 kilometers thick. Life on Titan would have to exist under extremely harsh conditions. This project considers the potential for life in Titan\u2019s ocean, where the temperature ranges from -20 to 10 degrees Celsius and pressures reach 2,000 to 8,000 atmospheres, up to eight times the pressure measured under 11 km of seawater at the deepest point of Earth\u2019s ocean. \u201cThe essential chemical building blocks for life are present in the atmosphere, but Titan\u2019s surface is quite inhospitable to life as we know it because of its extremely low temperature, \u2011180 C and the absence of liquid water,\u201d said Fabien Kenig, professor of earth and environmental sciences at UIC and one of the principal investigators on the grant. \u201cWe believe life on Titan would have formed using atmospheric chemical building blocks that entered the oceans through processes like convection or interactions of liquid water with the moon\u2019s rocky core. The ocean and the ocean floor are much more habitable, supportive environments for life than Titan\u2019s frigid surface.\u201d Scientists generally agree that life in Titan\u2019s ocean would be microbial (small size, single-cell organisms). Diagram of the internal structure of Titan according to the fully differentiated dense-ocean model. (Illustration: Kelvinsong, from Wikimedia Commons) \u201cLife on Titan most likely would have inhabited the ocean, where organisms would have given off metabolic waste products and potentially even left fragments,\u201d said D\u2019Arcy Meyer-Dombard, associate professor of earth and environmental sciences at UIC and co-principal investigator on the grant. \u201cSome of these biosignatures would eventually be transported to the ice sheet above, and possibly through the ice sheet back to the surface and possibly the atmosphere by geological processes, but we need to know what signatures to look for.\u201d The biosignatures would be detected using instruments that could be sent to orbit or land on the surface of Titan in the future. Meyer-Dombard and Kenig will re-create conditions found in Titan\u2019s ocean in the laboratory, grow microorganisms under these conditions (high pressure, extreme cold), and look for characteristic chemical and biological signatures that could help other researchers detect and identify life, or traces of extinct life forms on Titan and beyond. To mimic the deep underwater zone where life is believed to have most likely existed if it did, Meyer-Dombard and Kenig will re-create the conditions of Titan\u2019s ocean in the laboratory. To do so they must construct and maintain a growth chamber at approximately -15 C at extremely high pressure. Pressures on Titan are two to eight times higher than previously explored life-supporting environments on Earth. They will use different kinds of microorganisms such as strains of the bacteria Moritella or Archaea, Pyrococcus as model Titan life forms to grow in the chamber, but these organisms will have to be trained to grow at very high pressure. They will also use organisms found in environments on Earth that are \u201canalog\u201d environments to those on Titan. Because of the intense high pressure and extremely low temperatures, the microorganisms will grow and divide very slowly. The researchers anticipate leaving the microorganisms in the chamber for several years, occasionally \u2014 and very carefully \u2014 siphoning off a small sample of cells to examine. \u201cBecause of the high pressure, we need to be very careful with this chamber, especially when we are going in to collect samples,\u201d Kenig said. Kenig and Meyer-Dombard have a few ideas for the design of the growth chamber, which they estimate will be about the size of a ping-pong ball. These kinds of experiments have never been attempted before. Kenig and Meyer-Dombard believe that the microorganisms they grow in their chamber will exhibit alterations in gene expression as well as membrane morphology and composition. \u201cThe high pressure could cause changes in the cell membrane that enable it to remain fluid and flexible under such high pressure \u2014 specifically, the lipids in the membrane could become shortened. If we know what these high-pressure induced changes look like, we can look for them in samples that may be collected one day on Titan or on other similar moons or planets,\u201d Kenig\u00a0said. \n\nContact\n\nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nResearch \n \nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n Categories \nResearch  Topics astrobiology, solar system, space, Titan Sharon Parmet | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/titanhighres.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/2048px-Titan_poster.svg_.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/astrobiology", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/solar-system", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/space", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/titan", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/make-an-impact-on-ignite-givingtuesday": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNovember 22, 2018\t\t\t  Make an impact at UIC during IGNITE GivingTuesday on Nov. 27 \u2014 a day that aims to unify the campus community under the act of giving back.

We all come together, and it\u2019s so inspiring.\u201d Last year, IGNITE GivingTuesday raised more than $117,000 from about 700 donors. IGNITE GivingTuesday is part of a larger fundraising campaign on campus, called \u201cIGNITE: The Campaign for UIC,\u201d which launched last fall. The campaign\u2019s goal is to raise $750 million over five years to forge the future of education by redefining the student experience, empowering faculty, driving discovery and connecting to communities. As of Aug. 15, the campaign has raised more than $360 million \u2014 48 percent of its goal. \u201cThe IGNITE campaign aims to raise funds for student scholarships, endowed faculty positions, research and teaching technologies and improved campus facilities,\u201d Howell said. \u201cWe are all invested in making a tremendous impact at UIC.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nAriel Ridley\n\naridle2@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nAlumni, Campus, Featured Campus \n \nAriel Ridley\n\naridle2@uic.edu\n Categories \nAlumni, Campus, Featured Campus  Topics advancement, GivingTuesday, IGNITE Ariel Ridley | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/2018_GivingTuesday_Screensaver.jpg", "http://givingtuesday.uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/author/aridle2", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-alumni", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/advancement", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/givingtuesday", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/ignite", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/hospital-throws-holiday-party-for-young-patients": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNovember 19, 2018\t\t\t  More than 300 people \u2014 kids with cancer or sickle cell disease and their families \u2014 celebrated the holidays at UIC Nov. 17. The event, which was hosted by the pediatric hematology/oncology department of the Children\u2019s Hospital University of Illinois, included a Thanksgiving-inspired meal, holiday crafts, dancing and a gift exchange. \u201cToday is not about being a doctor or a patient,\u201d said Dr. Mary Lou Schmidt, professor of pediatrics and head of pediatric hematology and oncology. \u201cIt\u2019s about having fun.\u201d Volunteers from the Girl Scouts, A Silver Lining, Bear Necessities and others helped kids use paint, paper, beads and a host of other materials to make holiday crafts. Students from the UIC College of Dentistry dressed up as tooth fairies and as \u201cMr. Molar,\u201d encouraging kids to practice good brushing habits with a novelty-sized toothbrush and stuffed animals. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts provided supplies so kids could decorate their donuts, and eat their dessert before lunch if desired. The Joffrey Ballet\u2019s Exelon Strobel Dancers danced for and with attendees, young and old. For Kelly, mom of an 18-month-old\u00a0with leukemia, the event was also a celebration of her daughter\u2019s progress. \u201cKathryn was diagnosed one year ago today,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time last year, we were in the hospital. To see her running around today, healthy, means everything.\u201d The event was also meaningful to Kelly because two of Kathryn\u2019s three siblings were also there, along with their dad and Kelly\u2019s husband, Dan. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to spend so much time apart,\u201d said Kelly, who spent more than 190 days in the hospital last year with her daughter. \u201cFinding time to be together means everything.\u201d Schmidt says the event is about relationships\u00a0and celebration. \u201cCancer or sickle cell and a number of other conditions have touched everyone in this room, but we have so much to celebrate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have so many wonderful stories to tell.\u201d Javontae, 24, a Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\u00a0survivor, attended the event with his mom, sister, friend and a few cousins. \u201cI love being here with my family,\u201d said Javontae, who has been in remission for eight years. He said that while most of the activities are for younger kids, he still has a good time, especially with his younger family members. Supporting the event were more than 50 UIC volunteers, primarily from the College of Medicine, and 10 organizations, including Flashes of Hope, Gilda\u2019s Club, Holiday Heroes, Ladies Philoptochos Society and North Star Reach.

Under the terms of the agreement, which remains subject to review and approval by The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, the facility will be renamed Credit Union 1 Arena. Key terms of the agreement in principle will provide for Credit Union 1, an Illinois state-chartered credit union, to enter into a 15-year agreement with the University valued at $9.3 million. Additionally, Credit Union 1 will make a significant contribution of $750,000 toward supporting scholarships at UIC.

Meeting once a week with peer facilitators and mentors, Ignite participants gain access to valuable campus resources, along with gaining insight into the values, support, and competencies needed for positive involvement at UIC. Using a passion-driven action plan, students distinguish key identities, values, and issues that matter to them. Upon completion of the program, students will feel better connected with the UIC community, feel more in touch with their personal goals, and become a change agent for the future.

The Service Leaders Program is a leadership development program centered on service. She became involved with the Service Leaders Program because she \u201csaw that the current political climate created a need for students to be informed and actively engaged in civic and political matters.\u201d Her leadership role in the Service Leaders Program enables her to provide resources to UIC students \u201cthat allow them to be the change they want to see.\u201d She runs biweekly reflection and engagement sessions with student participants in the Service Leaders program, and supports students in figuring out how they want to be involved in bettering their communities. In addition, she assists students in building the skills they need to successfully contribute through the civic process. Marvely is energized that she gets to utilize her passion for helping others and creating a safe and progressive environment, and the knowledge she has gained from her own past mentors, to engage fellow students in their own exploration of service and civic engagement.

Marissa Scavelli is a current UIC junior and one of the mentors in Student Leadership and Civic Engagement\u2019s IGNITE program. IGNITE is a semester-long program for first-and second-year undergraduate students that explores the concepts of leadership and self-reflection. IGNITE students gain insight into the values, communication, and leadership competencies necessary for positive involvement at UIC. A key component of IGNITE are meetings with student mentors, upper-class students who share their experience with IGNITE participants. \u201cAs a first generation college student, it was hard for me to figure out college and to get involved. My first year on campus I was not involved with anything, which made it harder to make friends and find a sense of community at UIC,\u201d Marissa says. She chose to be an IGNITE student mentor this year because she thinks getting involved on campus gives students a sense of community. \u201cEspecially as a first year student, college is hard. Therefore a sense of community to fall back on makes a huge impact on students.\u201d Marissa values service, and she loves being a student mentor because she gets to share her knowledge with other students and help guide them through the beginning of their leadership journey. She says, \u201cI want to give back to students because I never had guidance when I began college. I believe my leadership role can be effective because I am helping the students I work with discover their own passions, goals and values.\u201d Beyond supporting fellow students through IGNITE, Marissa wants to use her education to be able to give back, and plans to go into the legal field after college. \u201cI am passionate about the law, more specifically how the law can oppress women. I am going into the legal field to protect and be a voice for women.\u201d Being a student mentor with IGNITE is helping her strengthen her leadership skills as she continues her own journey, from college through law school and eventually the legal profession. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site Posted on October 15, 2018 Modified on October 15, 2018 | ", "out_links": ["http://slce.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://slce.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://slce.uic.edu", "http://slce.uic.edu", "http://connect.uic.edu", "https://vcsa.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://slce.uic.edu/leadership/ignite/", "http://uic.edu", "http://slce.uic.edu", "http://clce.uic.edu/about/donate/", "http://vote.uic.edu", "https://uic.edu/", "https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "https://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "https://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "https://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/eventcal/eventcal.fcgi", "https://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "https://library.uic.edu/", "https://maps.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/", "https://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://slce.uic.edu/leadership": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari. \n    Skip to\n    \nthe content of this page,\n    \nthe main menu,\n        the secondary menu,\n        Google Translate,\n    the site search form\n    or go to the\n    the site home page.\n   Leadership Student Leadership and Civic Engagement believes that leadership is the process by which individuals facilitate positive social change.

Harassment and Sexual Misconduct UIC is committed to providing an educational and work environment that is free from all forms of sex discrimination, sexual violence, and sexual and gender-based harassment (collectively referred to as \u201csexual misconduct\u201d).\nUIC prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects through interim protective measures and accommodations, equitable investigations, and disciplinary processes. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, to determine when there have been violations of this policy based on the standard of preponderance of evidence, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC encourages good faith reports of sexual misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports sexual misconduct and/or who participates in a Title IX investigation or resultant disciplinary process. All employees are considered to be \u201cResponsible Employees\u201d with the authority and responsibility to report Sexual Misconduct to University Officials.\u00a0 Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment.

We realize our mission through academic programs, clinical services, research centers, and community programs. We conduct research and disseminate information about disability to academicians, policymakers, businesses, government agencies, service providers, and the general public. We also provide an extensive array of clinical and community service activities, and offer interdisciplinary pre-service training. The Institute on Disability and Human Development is a national leader in four areas: \u2026 all related to people with disabilities We emphasize the values of cultural diversity, consumer choice, and self-determination across the lifespan in all of our activities. The Department of Disability and Human Development is the only academic department in the disability studies field that provides a path from Minor to PhD and anything in between.  We are a nationally recognized research program where faculty, staff, and students engage in a variety of research-related activities, many which are integrated across community services projects -- thereby creating a direct link between research and practice.  To promote our culture of innovation and involvement, we offer continuing education for professionals who want to advance their knowledge and skills related to disability. Our community education events are perfect for individuals interested in learning more about disability. We are the University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service (UCEDD) for Illinois. This makes us part of a national network of 67 UCEDDs (there\u2019s at least one in every U.S. state and territory). We work collaboratively with our sister agencies, the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities and Equip for Equality, the State Protection and Advocacy Agency, to make up the Illinois Developmental Disabilities Network. \u00a0 Entities now known as UCEDDs were initially created over four decades ago with the enactment of Public Law 88-164 (1963) to serve people with developmental disabilities. Currently authorized under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (the DD Act), UCEDDs are now a resource for Americans with a wide range of disabilities. They receive their core funding from the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) within the Administration for Community Living (ACL), US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Each UCEDD is affiliated with a major research university and serves as a resource for all people in the areas of education, research, and service relative to the needs of people with developmental disabilities. Their programs are part of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), a membership organization that supports and promotes a national network of university-based interdisciplinary programs. We offer most of our pre-service training activities through the Department of Disability and Human Development (DHD). DHD\u2019s PhD in disability studies is the first of its kind in the nation and one of only a few in the world.\u00a0 DHD\u00a0is also home to the federally-designated Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) program for the State of Illinois. Our\u00a0advisory committee\u00a0is comprised of individuals with disabilites, family members, and partner organizations in Illinois.\u00a0 The IDHD/LEND advisory committee\u00a0provides information, feedback, and advice to our staff on how to advance the lives of people with disabilities in the state through their work. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n\n\n\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n\n\n\n Search the site  Read our annual report         College of Applied Health Sciences | ", "out_links": ["http://ahs.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://ahs.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://ahs.uic.edu/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/admissions-and-programs/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development#centers", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/continuing-education-and-community-training/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/community-partners/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/admissions-and-programs/phd-in-disability-studies/", "https://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/leadership-education-in-neurodevelopmental-and-related-disabilities/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/", "https://dscc.uic.edu/", "http://publichealth.uic.edu/chs", "http://publichealth.uic.edu/", "https://cms.ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/09/FY-2018-annual-report_-FINAL.pdf", "http://uic.edu", "http://ahs.uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "https://my.uic.edu/common/", "http://www.uic.edu/depts/accc/google/", "https://webmail.uic.edu/", "http://ahs.uic.edu/social-media/", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://news.uic.edu/uicnews", "http://www.uic.edu/depts/dos/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://ahs.uic.edu/disability-human-development/admissions-and-programs/phd-in-disability-studies": {"text": "\n        Skip to\n    \nthe content of this page,\n    \nthe main menu,\n                    the secondary menu,\n                Google Translate,\n        the site search form\n        or go to the\n        the site home page.\n     Promoting the full participation, self-determination and equal citizenship of people with disabilities Disability studies scholars view disability not simply as a defect inside a person, but as a complex relationship between society and people who function differently from the norm. UIC\u2019s PhD in\u00a0disability\u00a0studies program addresses\u00a0disability in its full complexity,\u00a0promoting an awareness of disability that supports individuals in shaping their identities and lives.\u00a0We examine how support\u00a0services and\u00a0social and political change can reduce sources of disempowerment. Disability studies at UIC offers a unique opportunity to study the multilayered, interactional dynamics\u00a0of disability. Our program is truly an interdisciplinary experience, with\u00a0faculty, researchers, and students coming from backgrounds in health, education, assistive technology, social sciences\u00a0and humanities.\u00a0We recognize the inherent tensions that exist between therapeutic, medical and social models of disability, but acknowledge these differences as fertile ground for the development of disability studies as an\u00a0integrative knowledge base. Students enroll in our program for a variety of reasons and with a variety of goals for when they graduate, including\u00a0academic positions, disability policy and advocacy, and visual or performing arts. A PhD in\u00a0disability\u00a0studies gives you\u00a0advanced knowledge about complex social implications of disability. You\u2019ll develop the\u00a0skills to lead research, policy analysis, and program evaluation and\u00a0development in ways that best address the perspectives of people with disabilities.

We have pod casts, curricula, decision trees, and other new products that you can use to reduce health disparities. Visit the web site for the new Center The Center provides a series of tools to advance self-determination and person-driven services for use by people with psychiatric disabilities. View Tools The National Research and Training Center on Psychiatric Disability (NRTC) promotes access to effective consumer-driven and community-based services for adults with serious mental illness.  The Center is located at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the Department of Psychiatry. To enhance use of evidence-based practice in mental health and rehabilitation,\r\n      a program of rigorous research examines the outcomes of recovery self-management\r\n      models, consumer-to-consumer education, self-directed healthcare financing\r\n      mechanisms, Medicaid-funded peer services, consumer-operated programs,\r\n      and return-to-work services. The Center provides data-driven information, technical assistance, and\r\n      training that foster evidence translation, systems transformation, and\r\n      workforce development. Training and education include projects on consumer\r\n      leadership development, client self-advocacy, peer provider certification,\r\n      financial asset development, preparing for research careers, and inpatient\r\n      seclusion and restraint reduction. An innovative academic curricular transformation effort incorporates principles\r\n      of recovery and evidence-based practice into university instruction in\r\n      the medical, social, and behavioral sciences. Also offered are online workshops,\r\n      web casts, web-based continuing education courses, and a state of the science national summit held in  April 2009.

Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services  \u00a0           \n Safety Tips\n Being alert and using common sense are the best ways to prevent crime from happening to you and those around you. continued vigilance are necessary to help you from becoming a victim of a crime. By taking a few simple steps you can reduce the possibility of becoming a victim.  Residence Halls                    While thefts, robberies and other unlawful activity occur at a relatively low rate, following basic crime prevention tips will assist in mitigating the risk of becoming a victim. When entering the residence halls please adhere to all rules and guidelines of access.DO NOT ALLOW STRANGERS OR UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS INTO CONTROLLED AREAS. Make sure that you lock your doors and windows when leaving your room. A majority of our reported thefts from residence rooms occur when the victim has left to go to the bathroom, visit a friend or a variety of other reasons for an relatively short amount of time. lastly it is very imperative that any and all suspicious persons be reported IMMEDIATELY to UICPD. a delay could mean the difference in preventing an unlawful act or apprehending the offender during a crime. When in doubt CALL.  If your windows or doors do not lock properly contact your RA immediately for repairs .Keep valuables out of plain view. Never loan your keys to anyone.  Keep curtains and blinds closed at night.  Install a light timer for use when not occupying your room.  Always identify anyone before allowing them into your room.  Never tape your door lock or use door jams, you may forget when you leave your room.  Keep your backpacks in your room when dinning, designated backpack spaces are rarely monitored and leaving them unattended is an invitation for theft.  Purchase a plastic key chain coil to secure your keys when showering.   Engrave all high dollar valuables with a personal identification such as initials and last 4 of social. If you do not have an engraver contact Officer Moran at (312) 996-6779 Street Sense  Be alert to your surroundings. however possible travel with a friend. Walk closely to the curb and avoid doorways, bushes, alleys and other areas where someone could hide. If you carry a purse, your personal safety may dictate how tightly you cling to it. During cooler weather carry your purse underneath your outer garment. If someone snatches it, let it go. It is easier to replace material items verses sustaining bodily injury from a purse snatcher.

Open House gatherings will be held on the dates shown below, many of which are days when Chicago Public Schools and some suburban districts do not have school: Computer Science Student Volunteers at the campus-wide open house on Sept. 22nd. UIC Preview is an opportunity to visit and hear from financial aid, housing and undergraduate colleges. This is a half-day program with campus and residence hall tours. 8AM\u00a0 \u2013 1PM | UIC Student Center East (750 S. Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60607) Do you have specific questions about Computer Science at UIC? Email:  recruit@cs.uic.edu Phone: call Elena or Christina at (312) 413-4950 The Open House information will apply to both categories of entering students. Transfer students should also see the engineering transfer student school guides.  We have various starting points in our program, accommodating both students who have never taken computer science courses as well as students who already have an extensive background.  Though content is geared primarily towards students, participating in an Open House will give you a good perspective on Computer Science in general and our program in particular.  No, there is no cost, nor are you obligated in any way. This is simply an opportunity for you to learn more about what it would be like to study CS at UIC.  For Computer Science Open House events that are on the same date as university-wide events, we encourage you to attend the university and college portions as well, however you may attend only the Computer Science portion if you are already familiar with the university and the college. If this is the case, please include a comment to this effect when you register.  See this website.  The Computer Science Department is one of six departments within the College of Engineering, which in turn is one of many colleges that are part of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). If you would like information on the College as a whole, visit the\u00a0College of Engineering website.\u00a0Often the College as a whole has recruiting events of which we in Computer Science are a part, which is why you may receive two different letters.

Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60607)     Does it matter if I'm a transfer student and not a student graduating from high-school?  What if I'm interested in Computer Science, but I haven't yet taken any Computer Science classes? What if I'm a high school counselor or teacher and would like to attend? Is there any cost or obligation if I attend an Open House? I'm already familiar with the University as a whole. Can I attend only the Computer Science portion of the Open House? Where can I get information on general UIC campus tours/visits? I received letters from the Computer Science Department and also from the College of Engineering at UIC. Are they the same thing? Where can I find more information about the CS undergraduate program at UIC? What sort of research is being done in Computer Science at UIC?

Our advocates are fully trained to state standards (40 hour sexual assault advocacy and 40 hour domestic violence advocacy) and have extensive training in stalking. They have many years of experience helping victims navigate systems they need to access on campus, including university administrative systems such as Title IX investigations and student conduct hearings, and off campus, including the criminal court system and the civil court system for obtaining Orders of Protection and No Contact Orders. In addition to direct victim services we also offer education and training on these topics as well as programming about prevention education, bystander intervention, and men\u2019s initiatives. At CAN we believe that all women and men deserve safety from harm, and we believe this safety may be achieved in multiple ways. We respect that gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, religious beliefs and ability can be factors that shape experience with violence. If you are the victim of sexual assault/abuse, domestic/dating violence, stalking or a hate crime you can speak to a specially trained advocate in a confidential and safe setting. Recognizing that each situation is unique we will identify the specific options available to you both on and off campus, and we will help you evaluate the benefits and/or drawbacks of each option. You are not required to take any action, but if you choose to do so we will help you navigate the processes and procedures you decide to pursue. We will also create a safety plan for you to avoid further harm, and we will help you address the emotional impact of your experience by providing psycho-education about the type of violence you have experienced and because we are not counselors we provide referrals to counseling/therapeutic services on campus and in community agencies for ongoing support. If you are a student we can support you with academic advocacy (negotiating with professors, financial aid, referrals to campus support services, housing assignments, etc.) and institutional advocacy (human resources, departmental support, etc.) if you are a staff or faculty member. We can accompany you to processes that occur on and off campus, including criminal court cases, petitions for protective orders in civil court, student conduct hearings, and meetings and investigations with the UIC or Chicago police, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, the UIC Title IX investigators and the Dean of Students\u2019 office. For additional information, please visit the Campus Advocacy Network\u2019s website at can.uic.edu.

SMS messages \u2014 issued only in cases of immediate threat to health and safety, such as a tornado alert, or a major disruption to travel \u2014 are faster and more reliable than e-mail. The campus strongly recommends that you register your cell phone for SMS messages at sms.uic.edu  On Wednesday, September 27, at 8:20 a.m., UIC initiated an unannounced UIC ALERT test to all faculty, staff and student email addresses. A text message, or SMS, was also sent to those people who have elected to register their mobile phone number.  UIC ALERT messages were also posted to UIC Twitter and Facebook accounts, www.uic.edu,  www.emergency.uic.edu, and on some UIC college and department websites.   Delivering timely, consistent, and accurate information is critical should conditions develop on or near the university that pose a threat of imminent danger. The UIC ALERT emergency notification system uses multiple communications methods to alert the campus community to critical life-safety situations, to advise self-protection from imminent threats, and to inform the community of other conditions regarding the operation of the campus.   You are strongly encouraged to sign up for UIC ALERT by visiting uic-alert.accc.uic.edu. You do not need to re-enroll each year and you can add up to three (3) numbers to receive notifications.  The Office of the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services: Office of Preparedness and Response encourages students, faculty and staff to take actions to become more involved in preparing themselves and their communities. Everyone can play a role in planning for the unexpected.   For more information on UIC Ready and on how to prepare and respond to emergency situations that may arise while on campus, visit www.ready.uic.edu/emergency_guide.   UIC ALERT TEST: This concludes the TEST of the emergency notification system   UIC ALERT TEST: The UIC ALERT emergency notification system is being tested. No action is required at this time. In an actual emergency, visit emergency.uic.edu or call 312-413-9696 for more information or instructions.  To subscribe your cell phone to receive emergency text message alerts, login to sms.accc.uic.edu.  UIC ALERT emergency notification messages are issued to notify all students, staff and faculty of imminent or ongoing threats to safety, security or health.   UIC ALERT: All Clear at University Hall.

The diversity of the members of our campus community will be apparent and, moreover, UIC will be known as an institution of higher education where diversity is a cornerstone of intellectual achievement. As a truly diverse institution, UIC will engage citizens from all the communities of Chicago and all the many other communities that comprise the state which we serve. UIC is one of the most diverse campuses in the United States and a great place to study, learn, work, and prepare for the global interdependence of people and markets. The seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are a collaborative group that aims to make UIC a welcoming and inclusive place for all students, faculty and staff. The Centers are committed to student success, intercultural engagement, vibrant scholarship, and dynamic community partnerships. While the presence of numerically diverse students, faculty, and staff can be critical to challenging assumptions about the status quo and to providing fresh approaches that can help to invigorate\u2014and democratize\u2014the academy, representational diversity is not an airborne virus whose mere presence spreads the beneficial outcomes of diversity. Representational diversity is a resource that must be intelligently and intentionally drawn on to be appreciated and ultimately produce positive outcomes. Representational diversity is but the first step in a spectrum of intentional efforts designed to maximize the benefits of diversity by incorporating it in our living, teaching, learning, research and public service.\r\n\r\nGoal 6 calls for systemic change to the ways we regard and reward diversity work by faculty and students and the way in which we assess academic programs. We expect students to learn more about diversity, and faculty and staff will have opportunities, methods, and resources for developing diversity competencies. New vehicles for communicating about diversity will be offered as will resources for encouraging collaboration among researchers and practitioners of diversity. Many are attracted to UIC by its diversity, but simple exposure to difference cannot transform our campus into a thriving community that values difference. Everyone at UIC must consciously and deliberately work to create an environment that welcomes varied identities if we are to create a community distinguished by principles and practices of diversity, equity, and social justice. Goal 3 focuses on our interactions with, and understandings of each other, both of which are needed if we are to fully appreciate the contributions of others. The ultimate goal of creating a climate of diversity and equity is not to make everybody feel good about themselves. Rather, the goal is to build a culture in which individuals are poised for the pursuit of excellence and offered many and varied opportunities to achieve it.\r\n\r\nWe must begin by knowing our campus climate as it truly is. UIC will assess the climate experienced by its staff, students, and faculty by means of a periodically reiterated survey. When we identify shortcomings, we will design solutions. Climate surveys will make a special point of considering accessibility issues that impact equal participation in and enjoyment of campus life by all individuals, including those with disabilities. UIC will strive to implement principles of universal design in physical planning of space and facilities.  Foundational to the UIC Strategic Plan are core values identified as \u201cso essential to UIC that they inform every element of individual and institutional practice.\u201d  They include: Knowledge, Openness, Access, Excellence, Collaboration and Caring. With these values as foundational to our institutional culture, we further state our commitment to diversity, which must extend beyond policies and statements, to ensure our campus climate is such that all our community members feel welcomed and valued. The values articulated below and in the diversity strategic thinking report, Through the Lens of Diversity, emerged from UIC\u2019s diversity strategic planning initiative as essential to a truly diverse university. Our values must be infused in every aspect of the work of the university. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n\nEnvelope icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join Our Mailing List \n\nPhone icon\n\n\n\n\n\n Like Us On Facebook \n\nDocument icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read What's On Our Bookshelf \n\nUser icon\n\n\n\n\n\n Photos \n  A Mosaic for UIC Transformation\n   \n  Mission Statement\n    Diversity Strategic Plan UIC Today | Posted on December 13, 2018 Frida Sanchez | Diversity Communications | Posted on September 19, 2018 Diversity Communications, Luisa J.

Policy Title:\u00a0Student Academic Grievance Policy Unit Responsible for Policy:\u00a0Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Effective Date:\u00a0April 27, 2017 Policy Statement:\u00a0All UIC Students have the right to appeal adverse academic decisions or actions through a formal University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Academic Grievance process that is fair, takes a reasonable amount of time, and provides the Student with requisite levels of due process. Across UIC, the Academic Grievance process will include at least three stages: (1) the Student makes a sincere attempt to resolve their complaint informally with the Respondent (except\u00a0in complaints or grievances that include complaints of unlawful discrimination or sexual misconduct, where an attempt at informal resolution is\u00a0not\u00a0required); (2) the Student/Grievant files a formal Academic Grievance with the appropriate Administrative Officer (AO) or their designee, which the AO attempts to resolve; and (3) if the Grievant is not satisfied with the AO\u2019s decision, she/he/they may appeal the decision to the appropriate Grievance Officer (GO). Decisions of the GO are final and cannot be appealed\u00a0except\u00a0in matters where a claim of sexual misconduct or unlawful discrimination has been made by the Student in the Academic Grievance and reviewed by the AO/GO, or where the Student has alleged that a significant procedural error(s) occurred in the Academic Grievance process that could substantially affect the outcome of the decision. In these cases, the Chancellor or their designee will review the record and issue a decision. The Chancellor\u2019s decision is final and no further appeal is available. Depending on the type of decision that is being grieved, the GO, or their designee, may make a decision independently or may convene a hearing. For Academic Grievances of serious adverse decisions (Level 1) that will prevent a Student from continuing their progress toward a degree in good academic standing, GOs are required to convene a three-person Hearing Panel and conduct a Formal Hearing. For Level 2 academic grievances, related to academic decisions that will not prevent a Student from continuing their progress toward a degree in good academic standing, all grievances may be considered, except those involving grades or evaluations that are entirely based on a subjective judgment by a University agent, unless the grievance involves an allegation of unlawful discrimination or sexual misconduct. To guide the implementation of this policy, a procedures document will outline the expectations for each stage, the responsibilities of the AO and GO, and timelines. The Grievant will be notified about the process for filing a formal Academic Grievance, deadlines for each stage, and the opportunity to appeal the AO\u2019s decision if the Academic Grievance is not resolved at that stage. If there is a claim of unlawful discrimination and/or sexual misconduct, the Office for Access and Equity will review the complaint, conduct an investigation of the unlawful discrimination and/or sexual misconduct as appropriate, determine findings, and advise the AO and GO throughout the process. To allow for flexibility across UIC, all of UIC\u2019s colleges are required to have college-level policies and procedures in place that outline how the three stages of the process will be implemented, given the specific context of the college. Colleges may further extend or enhance the process in accordance with related accreditation or professional standards. Students must be notified about college-level academic grievance procedures through student handbooks and/or through program websites. These college-specific academic grievance procedures will be submitted to the Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for review and approval. For undergraduate and professional students, all three stages of the process will remain in their academic college with the appeal to the Chancellor, as described above.\u00a0 For graduate students filing Level 1 academic grievances, the first two stages of the process (informal and AO) will reside in the academic college, with the third stage (GO) moving to the Graduate College. For graduate students filing Level 2 academic grievances, all three stages of the process will remain in their academic college. Again, for all cases filed by graduate students, the appeal to the Chancellor is limited as set forth above. All colleges must report the number of academic grievances filed to the Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs annually, as well as any college-specific modifications to the student academic grievance procedures implemented in the previous year. Reason for Policy:\u00a0Although student academic grievance procedures have been in force since 2007, UIC has not previously issued a formal policy indicating that students have the right to grieve adverse academic decisions. The goals with the current policy are to ensure that (1) a single person makes a single decision (e.g., the policy and updated procedures prohibit the Administrative Officer from serving as Grievance Officer or as a member of the Hearing Panel); and (2) to allow the process to vary for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to accommodate various college structures or college-level procedures that supplement the UIC procedures. Minority Impact Statement:\u00a0This policy does not have any disproportionate or unique impact on UIC\u2019s minority students, staff, or faculty. Who Should Read the Policy:\u00a0\u00a0All students, faculty, staff, and administrators. Definitions: Procedures:\u00a0\u00a0View the Student Academic Grievance Procedures.

UIC is committed to a fair and balanced review process that utilizes a multitude of factors in an effort to select the students who are best equipped to transition to and graduate in four years from UIC. Freshman Admission Freshman admission is for students under 24 credit hours and the full completion of high school courses. For further details, please click here. Transfer Admission For fullest consideration, a transfer grade point average of 2.50/4.00 on the basis of all transferable work attempted is recommended. Transcripts should illustrate a minimum of 24 semester or 36 quarter hours of transferable college classroom credit at the time of application. College and departmental requirements vary. For further details, please click here. The Office of Student Veteran Affairs handles all inquiries about educational benefits, including the G.I. Bill (Montgomery, Post 9/11, 1606, 1607, and Vocational Rehab) and Illinois Veteran\u2019s Grant and Illinois National Guard Grant. Should you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us. The first step would be to contact the Department of Veteran Affairs (888-442-4551) to inquire about the benefit that you qualify for. Once you are admitted to the university, present your letter of eligibility, along with a copy of your DD-214 to the Office of Student Veteran Affairs. http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/ Toll-free: 1-888-GI-BILL1 or 1-888-442-4551 A completed file with a completed Academic Advisor form, G.I. Bill Benefits form, letters of eligibility and DD-214 can be processed within one day. Each semester, students must have their Academic Advisor form completed and signed by an academic advisor for enrollment to be reported to the VA. The VA is the last payer for tuition benefits and can take up to 4 to 6 weeks to send payment back to the university. BAH (Basic Housing Allowance) payments go directly to the student and usually arrive to a student\u2019s account on the 1st of each month. To set up direct deposit with the VA, the student will need to contact the VA directly. UIC\u2019s Student Veterans Association is very active with programs throughout the academic year. The Office of Student Veteran Affairs conducts activities throughout the year to help foster a positive academic experience for our student veterans, including the VITAL program, which is in conjunction with Jesse Brown VA Hospital. There isn\u2019t a different process for veteran students. Student veterans adhere to the same admissions requirements as all students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site Should you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us.

The gift will establish a term naming of the UIC Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum, which stands on a stretch of Roosevelt Road the young family often traveled. In addition, the gift will provide scholarships to undergraduate students with high academic achievement who graduated from a Cook County high school. To honor this generous gift from the Dorin Family Foundation, we held a ribbon cutting ceremony to formally announce the term naming of the UIC Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum and celebrate the legacy of the Dorin family. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site Posted on May 04, 2018 Go to slide 1 Go to slide 2 Go to slide 3 Go to slide 4 Go to slide 5 Go to slide 6 Go to slide 7 Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Go to the next slide Go to the previous slide Modified on May 04, 2018 | ", "out_links": ["http://advance.uic.edu/giving/", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "https://give.uic.edu/", "https://give.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "https://uic.edu/", "https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "https://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "https://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "https://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/eventcal/eventcal.fcgi", "https://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "https://library.uic.edu/", "https://maps.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/", "https://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://advance.uic.edu/take-our-survey": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari. \n    Skip to\n    \nthe content of this page,\n    \nthe main menu,\n        Google Translate,\n    the site search form\n    or go to the\n    the site home page.\n   \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site  File upload  \n\nFirst\n \n\nLast\n | ", "out_links": ["http://advance.uic.edu/giving/", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "https://give.uic.edu/", "https://give.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu", "http://advance.uic.edu", "https://uic.edu/", "https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "https://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "https://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "https://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/eventcal/eventcal.fcgi", "https://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "https://library.uic.edu/", "https://maps.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/", "https://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://impact.uic.edu": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari. \n    Skip to\n    \nthe content of this page,\n    \nthe main menu,\n        Google Translate,\n    the site search form\n    or go to the\n    the site home page.\n    Host a UIC Impact Engagement Experience!

Our strength derives from our devoted top-tier faculty and staff who share a commitment to the promise of public education, the advancement of knowledge in their scholarly fields, and the imperatives of social justice and civic engagement. Furthermore, our entire university community embraces an ethic of care for the well-being of those we serve. While there are many public research universities, none is, like UIC, so quintessentially positioned at the intersection of research and urban life. Located in the heart of Chicago, we are on the cutting edge of scholarship and service for a rapidly urbanizing world. We also hold the distinction of being one of Illinois\u2019 leading health care providers, with an expansive health care education and services enterprise throughout the state. We benefit from the deep relationships we have with the neighborhoods we serve, and in turn we give back by helping build and support just and sustainable communities. Today, UIC must look ahead even as we face a widening disjuncture between contemporary demands and our institutional capacity to respond. Limited state support, increasing demands, and an ever-changing economic and demographic environment require that we become a more entrepreneurial university \u2013 an institution positioned to fulfill its public purpose despite external constraints. To do so we must leverage our strengths to shape the future, while our commitment to education, scholarship, community engagement, and social justice will continue to be our guiding principle driving UIC forward. The following set of strategic priorities provide fresh thinking for how, over the next five years, we can leverage our strengths to shape the future by supporting our students, enhancing our reputation on a national and international stage, engaging Chicago and its communities, and operating in new ways to foster and advance innovation.

Team Challenge is an experiential program consisting of activities and low elements designed to help organizations improve communication, solve problems, build trust, and establish greater understanding and appreciation for all team members. Team programs are tailored to meet each group\u2019s individual goals and abilities. No two programs are identical! With the guidance of trained facilitators, groups participate in a series of physically and intellectually challenging activities that help identify various group dynamics. Immediately following each challenge, facilitators lead the group through reflection to evaluate and understand the activities. The entire experience creates a commonality amongst the group that lays the foundation for trust and commitment between team members. The Team Challenge Program is designed to appeal to a wide variety of groups including but not limited to: UIC students, UIC faculty/staff, community and corporate groups. The program is not tailored to any particular groups. Our \u201cchallenge by choice\u201d philosophy allows participants to feel comfortable while contributing to the activity. Whether you are an established group or are just getting to know each other, the UIC Team Challenge Program has something to offer you.

Entre Prises\u2019 is the world\u2019s premier climbing wall manufacturer and Free Form is the most advanced product in climbing wall technology. Free Form accurately simulates the look, feel, and detail of real rock! Our wall is 43 feet tall, 7 top ropes across, and has a stunning variety of built in features such as: cracks, flakes, pockets, ar\u00eates, a dihedral, as well as endless intricate features. Rock-climbing is a multi-dimensional sport that requires strength and flexibility, as well as a high level of endurance and skill. It also offers a balance between physical exercise and mental discipline. Climbers will quickly begin to develop hand, arm, back, and core strength as a result of the movements the climber needs to scale the wall. With practice, climbers will see improvement in agility, their ability to increase strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility in hips and hamstrings. In addition, our friendly staff would love to introduce you to this popular and fast growing sport. We are constantly changing our routes to challenge every type of climber from beginner to advanced skill levels. Each route varies in length and style so climbs never get tedious.

In short, active learning requires students to do meaningful learning activities and think about and apply what they are learning. While this definition could include traditional activities such as homework, in practice, active learning refers to activities that are introduced into the classroom. The core elements of active learning are student activity and engagement in the learning process. Active learning is often contrasted to the traditional lecture where students passively receive information from the instructor.  SCALE-UP stands for \u201cStudent-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies\u201d or \u201cStudent\u2010Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.\u201d SCALE-UP classrooms include round tables of nine students to facilitate group interactions, white boards near each table, networked computers and an instructor area located near the center of the room. Other acronyms that are used by universities for SCALE-UP\u00a0environments are: Examples North Carolina State University (SCALE-UP) Design: \u00a0  Research: Video:   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (TEAL) Design:  \u00a0 \u00a0  Research: Video:  University of Minnesota (ALC)\n Design:  \u00a0 \u00a0  Research: Video:   University of Iowa (TILE) Design: \u00a0  Research: Video:  LearnLab is a flexible, tech-enabled classroom that is anything but traditional. Instead of rows of desks facing forward, where the podium is the stage and blackboard the backdrop, LearnLab removes the front of the room by positioning chairs and tables into an \u201cX\u201d configuration. Design: Richland College  \u00a0 \u00a0  Research: Video:   The new Learning Studios provided faculty and learners with an opportunity to experiment with radical flexibility in space, furnishings, and technology\u2014all targeted at increasing student engagement and success. Design: California State University, Fresno \u00a0  Research: Video: Team-based learning (TBL) is an instructional teaching method in which students work independently prior to the allotted class time to gain baseline subject matter knowledge. During class time they interact as a team (typically comprised of 4-7 students) towards a common goal of understanding class/course objectives. Compared to didactic lecture, the aim of TBL is to increase the level of the students\u2019 engagement and promote a higher level of learning within the content.

By conducting a series of comprehensive evaluations and measurements, our team can identify your fitness needs and provide you with an individualized exercise prescription. This exercise prescription can be designed to get you started or move you to the next fitness level and beyond. Why measure body composition? Weight alone is not a clear indicator of good health because it does not distinguish between body fat and lean body mass (muscle, bones, organs). \u00a0\u00a0Carrying too much fat can be a predisposition for many serious medical conditions including heart disease, diabetes and even certain forms of cancer. Additionally, knowing ones body composition serves as a starting point for a weight management program. Having a tangible result in the form of skin-fold measurements and/or percentages can help to chart progress. In fact, measuring body-fat regularly can serve to motivate and help an individual make necessary modifications to their program. How do we measure body composition? Skinfolds \u2013 a six site (men) or five site (women) skinfold test that assesses body composition (percentage body fat, lean body mass, ideal weight, and ideal percentage fat). A computer printout is given of all the results. \u00a0 Hydrostatic Weighing\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Hydrostatic (underwater) weighing,\u00a0 determines a person\u2019s total body density using Archimedes\u2019 Principle of displacement. This test has been considered the gold standard for body composition assessment and can provide an accurate measurement of fat vs. fat-free mass. For the most accurate results, please follow a 24-hour dietary restriction of no fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans or carbonated beverages.\u00a0 Please bring a swimsuit. Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)\nTired of diets that don\u2019t work? Find out how many calories your body burns in a day! RMR testing will assess your unique metabolism and find the rate at which you burn calories.\u00a0 This test takes about\u00a090 minutes to complete. After the test, you will know exactly how many calories you need to eat every day to gain, lose, or maintain your weight. You\u2019ll leave with a weekly plan of how many calories to eat, and how many calories to burn through exercise.

This measurement is generally considered the best indicator of an individual\u2019s cardiovascular fitness and aerobic endurance. The results will indicate your capacity to perform sustained exercise. This information will help in designing a comprehensive cardiovascular fitness program. You\u2019ll leave knowing:\n\u2022 how hard you need to exercise \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 how many times per week you need to exercise\n\u2022 how long you need to exercise This test requires medical referral from your physician. Most people know that cardiovascular exercise is important, but knowing how intense a workout should be is different for each individual and is dependent on goals and current fitness level. Lactate Tests help determine the correct training intensity to increase power and endurance.\u00a0 Knowing the\u00a0corresponding lactate values at a given heart rate range allows you to adjust your training to meet specific goals.\u00a0 Train smarter, not harder. \u00a0 Fine tune your program to reach your personal best.

First Massage Experience If this is your first massage session, your massage therapist will explain the procedures, techniques, and discuss your expectations for your massage session. We want you to be as comfortable as possible. Feel free to ask any questions to your therapist before or during your session. Here are some FAQ\u2019s. What do I wear? When you enter the massage room, your therapist will talk to you about any specifics for your massage and then leave the room for you to get undressed. You can undress to your level of comfort. You will lie underneath the top sheet. As your massage therapist works on you, he/she will expose only the area that will be worked on. \u00a0Can I work out before my massage? Yes, you can. But, please allow 30 minutes for your body to relax and get back to normal blood pressure and pulse. Please\u00a0SHOWER before your massage if you do workout. Not only for sanitary reasons, but also our lotion will not allow a smooth glide with certain techniques. Can I work out after my massage? Yes and No. Depending on the type of massage you received and how long it was. The deeper the work and the longer your session, your body needs recovery time. If you had a long, relaxing session, your body will not feel like doing anything but relaxing. Do I have to talk during the session? The main communication that needs to happen during your massage is for your comfort level, if you need more or less pressure, and/or if you experience pain in certain areas. General conversation during your massage is not necessary; you can talk as much as you would like or not at all. Do I have to drink water after my massage?

after is making students successful by having them gain knowledge, but also develop core skills and competencies. The fastest way to do that is through active learning.\u201d  Red push pins mark the \u201cOasis\u201d, informal learning spaces, on the East Campus of UIC.\nThese study spaces are available for student use during standard building hours.

Students started using the furniture the Monday morning after spring break.    Disability Health and Social Policy Building room 204 We created a new classroom for the Department of Disability and Human Development for their new undergraduate minor and proposed major. The classroom included new acoustical ceiling tile, dimmable lighting, motorized shades, whiteboards, finishes, furniture and Audio-Visual (AV) system. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Active Learning is generally defined as any instructional method that engages students in the learning process. In short, active learning requires students to do meaningful learning activities and think about and apply what they are learning. While this definition could include traditional activities such as homework, in practice, active learning refers to activities that are introduced into the classroom. The core elements of active learning are student activity and engagement in the learning process. Active learning is often contrasted to the traditional lecture where students passively receive information from the instructor.

The concepts and skills taught in this course will prepare you to prevent, identify and stabilize a diverse range of injuries and illnesses associated with recreation in remote places where adaptations to harsh environments, limited access to resources and communication, and personal/group safety must be made. Beginning with patient assessment, this course helps establish a foundation for students to make informed decisions during emergency situations when far from definitive healthcare systems. Topic List: Topics covered in our Wilderness First Aid course include an introductory level overview and practice of topics including patient assessment, respiratory distress emergencies, bleeding & wound management, shock, spine & head injuries, musculoskeletal injuries, environmental emergencies, abdominal illnesses & injuries, allergies & anaphylaxis, and emergency & evacuation plans. Inclusion of additional topics beyond what is listed can be discussed and agreed on upon request. Certification Guidelines: Our Wilderness First Aid (WFA) course involves a minimum of 16 hours of contact time. No exam is associated with this course. After successful completion of the course components, a student is granted a 2 year certification. No recertification course exists for this training. Instead, a student can participate in a new Wilderness First Aid (WFA) course and gain further certification. Schedule: Day 1: 8:00am-5:00pm Day 2: 8:00am-5:00pm A 1 hour lunch break is provided each day of this course. \u00a0 This course is offered to UIC Students, Members, and Non Members.

These informal learning environments are strategically located to complement classrooms and other formally structured learning environments. Initially, these spaces were targeted for leftover, marginal, and peripheral spaces in east campus classroom buildings. Some spaces were already used for vending, study carrels, or benches but were cold and uninviting; others were just extra floor area, either part of or adjacent to circulation space. They were all in buildings with centrally administered classrooms, and thus served no single academic department or college. Thus, there was no particular unit that took an interest in fixing up existing areas or creating new ones. Early Oasis projects were funded in a variety of ways: personal contributions from concerned faculty and administrators and pooled funds from a variety of academic units were supplemented by relatively small contributions from the Office of the Provost. On the strength of improvements realized through those early projects, later Oases have succeeded in securing funds from larger donations by alumni, and the Provost continues to contribute as well. Project Oasis is a wonderful gift to the UIC students made possible mostly through alumni donations. These are either small amounts given in support of the overall effort or larger amounts that enable a particular project to be realized. Small donations are used to help with non-construction costs. Large donations are sought based on the plans for a specific new Oasis, and are then applied directly to the construction costs (either with a match from the Provost or on their own) of the space they are given for. These donations are solicited in a cooperative effort between the Office of Campus Learning Environments and the UIC Development Office for spaces serving the broadest UIC populations. Project Oasis does not have any funds available to support planning and construction of Oases that are developed within individual academic departments. However, the Office of Campus Learning Environments is available for consultations on such projects and will help with design, funding opportunities, and construction management as needed. If there is a space that I think would make a good Oasis for UIC students, who should I talk to about it?\nThat depends on where the space is located. If the space is in a building associated with a particular college, talk to the dean or someone else in the dean\u2019s office first. If the space is located in an area without particular affiliation to an academic unit, contact the Office of Campus Learning Environments. OCLE can help with determining the suitability, and work with you to develop possible funding scenarios. If I am ready to work on getting an Oasis constructed, how can I get the money to do it?\nThere are a variety of ways to collect the funds needed for Oasis construction. If a number of different user-groups will benefit from the Oasis, petition the administrators of those campus units for contributions to the construction. If there is a single academic unit that benefits, the development office of the college should be approached for assistance in raising money for the project. If the project will serve a broad student need with no particular collegiate connection, the Office of Campus Learning Environments can work with the UIC Development Office to solicit an alumni donation for the project. Projects that succeed in capturing the interest of a donor may also be eligible for matching funds from the provost \u2019s office. If I have an Oasis project in mind, is there Project Oasis money available to help me?\nNo pre-existing Oasis fund exists that can be applied to for financial support in the realization of an Oasis project. If the project you have in mind is one that will serve a broad student need with no particular collegiate connection, the staff will work with you to develop a concept for the Oasis that can attract donor interest. The UIC Development Office will then look for opportunities to match a donor\u2019s interest with the idea. If your idea is targeted to a narrow group of users, the staff will help in the generation of a design concept to make a case that will enable you to seek funding for construction. Why are some Oases funded by Project Oasis, but others are not?\nLots of people all over campus are interested in improving the conditions in areas used by our students. Many have seen some of the completed Oases and wish to do something similar. If they have the resources and means, they undertake the project on their own without the involvement of the Office of Campus Learning Environments. Our office aims at providing relief in those areas where no other campus unit is likely to. But in reality, no Oases are funded by Project Oasis. They are funded by concerned faculty and administrators, by academic units (either solo or working in partnerships), or by alumni donations. What are the qualities that make a good Oasis for UIC students?\nThe best Oasis spaces have a number of things in common. Most are located near classrooms, providing a natural waiting area for students before and after attending class. They offer a stopping place adjacent to primary circulation paths. Since these spaces serve students, the display of UIC student artwork has been established as en essential element. The Office of Campus Learning Environments is available to help with the process of identifying and purchasing appropriate pieces for any Oasis space. Students study in Oasis spaces, so it is also essential that they provide good lighting and comfortable seating. Depending on the amount of space and its location, some have tables or other work surfaces and proximity to vending or other refreshments. They are intended to be lively and colorful zones with plants and artwork. \u00a9 Copyright 2013-2018 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois  ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu/",

UIC women\u2019s basketball coach, returned to Welsh-Ryan Arena eager to earn a road victory over Northwestern. UIC coach Tasha Pointer knew facing Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston would be tough. \u201cObviously, we wanted to win,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give our best effort.\u201d The difficult road game Nov. 15 against the Wildcats was scheduled way before the former NU assistant coach left last season to coach the Flames. Thursday night\u2019s game was the first time Pointer had appeared at Welsh-Ryan as a head coach. And though UIC lost 87-44, she feels the matchup can have a positive impact. \u201cNorthwestern came out and punched us first and we didn\u2019t know how to respond,\u201d Pointer told reporters after the game. \u201cFor UIC, we have to allow this game to drive us to be better.\u201d NU coach Joe McKeown praised Pointer\u2019s performance. \u201cI just think great things are ahead for her at UIC,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made a commitment to women\u2019s basketball when they hired her last spring. I think you\u2019re going to see that over the next couple of years.\u201d Pointer is confident the Flames will bounce back. \u201cFirst of all,\u00a0 Coach McKeown is a phenomenal coach. One of the things that I learned from him was \u2014 no matter what \u2014 run your stuff and have great expectations of your team and have your team execute,\u201d she said. Pointer had hoped for a more triumphant homecoming after beating Valparaiso 75-65 on Nov. 7. \u201cComing into the (NU) game I was just conflicted,\u201d she said. \u201cWho wants to lose to their former team and, for that matter, any team?\u201d Anytime you take over a program that hasn\u2019t been as successful, \u201cyou have to appreciate these moments and in between because they are teaching moments,\u201d Pointer said. \u201cMoving forward, for us at UIC, it is allowing moments like this to help elevate our mentality, our culture and really transform the program,\u201d she said. \u00a0 \n\nContact\n\nJeffron Boyn\u00e9s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-8702\njboynes@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nFlames Athletics \n \nJeffron Boyn\u00e9s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-8702\njboynes@uic.edu\n Categories \nFlames Athletics  Topics women's basketball Jeffron Boyn\u00e9s | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/pointer-disappointed-after-nu-loss/kd0a1758", "https://today.uic.edu/author/jboynes", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-flames-athletics", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/womens-basketball", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines": {"text": "The mission of Project Oasis is to create and support co-curricular study spaces for UIC students. These informal learning environments are strategically located to complement classrooms and other formally structured learning environments. Initially, these spaces were targeted for leftover, marginal, and peripheral spaces in east campus classroom buildings. Some spaces were already used for vending, study carrels, or benches but were cold and uninviting; others were just extra floor area, either part of or adjacent to circulation space. They were all in buildings with centrally administered classrooms, and thus served no single academic department or college. Thus, there was no particular unit that took an interest in fixing up existing areas or creating new ones. Early Oasis projects were funded in a variety of ways: personal contributions from concerned faculty and administrators and pooled funds from a variety of academic units were supplemented by relatively small contributions from the Office of the Provost. On the strength of improvements realized through those early projects, later Oases have succeeded in securing funds from larger donations by alumni, and the Provost continues to contribute as well. Project Oasis is a wonderful gift to the UIC students made possible mostly through alumni donations. These are either small amounts given in support of the overall effort or larger amounts that enable a particular project to be realized. Small donations are used to help with non-construction costs. Large donations are sought based on the plans for a specific new Oasis, and are then applied directly to the construction costs (either with a match from the Provost or on their own) of the space they are given for. These donations are solicited in a cooperative effort between the Office of Campus Learning Environments and the UIC Development Office for spaces serving the broadest UIC populations. Project Oasis does not have any funds available to support planning and construction of Oases that are developed within individual academic departments. However, the Office of Campus Learning Environments is available for consultations on such projects and will help with design, funding opportunities, and construction management as needed. If there is a space that I think would make a good Oasis for UIC students, who should I talk to about it?\nThat depends on where the space is located. If the space is in a building associated with a particular college, talk to the dean or someone else in the dean\u2019s office first. If the space is located in an area without particular affiliation to an academic unit, contact the Office of Campus Learning Environments. OCLE can help with determining the suitability, and work with you to develop possible funding scenarios. If I am ready to work on getting an Oasis constructed, how can I get the money to do it?\nThere are a variety of ways to collect the funds needed for Oasis construction. If a number of different user-groups will benefit from the Oasis, petition the administrators of those campus units for contributions to the construction. If there is a single academic unit that benefits, the development office of the college should be approached for assistance in raising money for the project. If the project will serve a broad student need with no particular collegiate connection, the Office of Campus Learning Environments can work with the UIC Development Office to solicit an alumni donation for the project. Projects that succeed in capturing the interest of a donor may also be eligible for matching funds from the provost \u2019s office. If I have an Oasis project in mind, is there Project Oasis money available to help me?\nNo pre-existing Oasis fund exists that can be applied to for financial support in the realization of an Oasis project. If the project you have in mind is one that will serve a broad student need with no particular collegiate connection, the staff will work with you to develop a concept for the Oasis that can attract donor interest. The UIC Development Office will then look for opportunities to match a donor\u2019s interest with the idea. If your idea is targeted to a narrow group of users, the staff will help in the generation of a design concept to make a case that will enable you to seek funding for construction. Why are some Oases funded by Project Oasis, but others are not?\nLots of people all over campus are interested in improving the conditions in areas used by our students. Many have seen some of the completed Oases and wish to do something similar. If they have the resources and means, they undertake the project on their own without the involvement of the Office of Campus Learning Environments. Our office aims at providing relief in those areas where no other campus unit is likely to. But in reality, no Oases are funded by Project Oasis. They are funded by concerned faculty and administrators, by academic units (either solo or working in partnerships), or by alumni donations. What are the qualities that make a good Oasis for UIC students?\nThe best Oasis spaces have a number of things in common. Most are located near classrooms, providing a natural waiting area for students before and after attending class. They offer a stopping place adjacent to primary circulation paths. Since these spaces serve students, the display of UIC student artwork has been established as en essential element. The Office of Campus Learning Environments is available to help with the process of identifying and purchasing appropriate pieces for any Oasis space. Students study in Oasis spaces, so it is also essential that they provide good lighting and comfortable seating. Depending on the amount of space and its location, some have tables or other work surfaces and proximity to vending or other refreshments. They are intended to be lively and colorful zones with plants and artwork. \u00a9 Copyright 2013-2018 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois  ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/search/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/ulist/az", "http://library.uic.edu/", "https://ocle.uic.edu", "https://ocle.uic.edu/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/classroom-renovations/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/learning-space-design-standards/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/upcoming-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/completed-projects-2/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/giving-to-project-oasis-2/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis/proposed-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/current-and-recent-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/list-of-oases-and-learning-centers/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/oasis-location-map/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/oasis-use-policy/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/your-oasis-experience-video-contest-winners/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/assessment/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/active-learning-environments/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/news/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/advisory-board/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/contact-us/", "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/#mission", "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/#goals", "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/#funding", "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/#faq", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/studentservices/disability.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/campus/emergency-information.shtml"]}, "http://recreation.uic.edu/memberships": {"text": "Tis the season for snow and salt!!\n\nPlease help us  keep our facility clean and equipment working properly by chang\u2026 https://t.co/Td9QOvh4pM -

The simple prospect of change and preparation for holidays and a new semester all of the sudden makes me feel like life is starting to move faster around me, yet I am stuck in place. Everything is changing, academically and in the rest of life. My family just adopted a new dog, and every day my mom sends me new videos of him.

I am now wrapping up my fifth semester at UIC, I\u2019m halfway through junior year, and I\u2019m over halfway done with college. I\u2019m almost there, but everything is still so unclear. To be quite honest, I have no idea what I want to do. While I love writing and social justice issues, there are just so many places to go with that. What if I choose the wrong path or make the wrong decision? Where should I try to intern? Will I have enough experience to make it out in the world? There are so many what ifs being stirred up with the ending of this semester. It is not even these next couple of weeks that I am worried about, but it is everything that follows. \u201cA year ago,\nYou did not know today.\nYou did not know\nHow you\u2019d make it here.\nBut you made it here.\nBy grace, you made it here.\u201d \u2013 Morgan Harper Nichols I read this poem the other day, and I wanted to share this refreshing thought.

2018\t\t\t The wonders of graphene are numerous \u2014 it can enable flexible electronic components, enhance solar cell capacity, filter the finest subatomic particles and revolutionize batteries. Now, the \u201csupermaterial\u201d may one day be used to test for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS \u2014 a progressive, neurodegenerative disease which is diagnosed mostly by ruling out other disorders, according to new research from the University of Illinois at Chicago published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. How graphene can be used to detect ALS biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid. (Credit: Berry Research Laboratory, UIC) When cerebrospinal fluid from patients with ALS was added to graphene, it produced a distinct and different change in the vibrational characteristics of the graphene compared to when fluid from a patient with multiple sclerosis was added or when fluid from a patient without neurodegenerative disease was added to graphene. These distinct changes accurately predicted what kind of patient the fluid came from \u2013 one with ALS, MS or no neurodegenerative disease. Graphene is a single-atom-thick material made up of carbon. Each carbon atom is bound to its neighboring carbon atoms by chemical bonds. The elasticity of these bonds produces resonant vibrations, also known as phonons, which can be very accurately measured. When a molecule interacts with graphene, it changes these resonant vibrations in a very specific and quantifiable way. \u201cGraphene is just one atom thick, so a molecule on its surface in comparison is enormous and can produce a specific change in graphene\u2019s phonon energy, which we can measure,\u201d said Vikas Berry, associate professor and head of chemical engineering in the UIC College of Engineering and an author on the paper. Changes in graphene\u2019s vibrational characteristics depend on the unique electronic characteristics of the added molecule, known as its \u201cdipole moment.\u201d \u201cWe can determine the dipole moment of the molecule added to graphene by measuring changes in graphene\u2019s phonon energy caused by the molecule,\u201d Berry explained. Berry and his colleagues used graphene to identify whether the cerebrospinal fluid was from a patient with ALS or multiple sclerosis \u2014 two progressive neurodegenerative disorders \u2014 or from someone without neurodegenerative disease. Since there is no definitive test for ALS, an objective diagnostic test would help patients start receiving treatment sooner to slow the disease. Vikas Berry, associate professor and head of chemical engineering at the UIC College of Engineering. (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center, which banks fluid and tissue from deceased individuals. Berry, Dr. Ankit Mehta, assistant professor of neurosurgery and director of spinal oncology in the UIC College of Medicine, and their colleagues tested the cerebrospinal fluid from seven people without neurodegenerative disease; from 13 people with ALS; from three people with multiple sclerosis and from three people with an unknown neurodegenerative disease. \u201cWe saw unique and distinct changes in graphene\u2019s phonon energies depending on whether the fluid was from someone with ALS, multiple sclerosis or someone without neurodegenerative disease,\u201d Berry said. \u201cWe were also able to determine whether the fluid was from someone over age 55 or younger than 55 when we tested cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients. We think the difference we see between older and younger ALS patients is driven by unique biochemical signatures we are picking up that correlate to inherited ALS, which usually produces symptoms before age 55, and what\u2019s known as sporadic ALS which occurs later in life.\u201d Berry believes the graphene is picking up on the unique biosignatures \u2014 combinations of proteins, and other biomolecules \u2014 present in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with different diseases. \u201cThe electronic properties of graphene have been extensively studied, but only recently have we begun to examine its phononic properties as a way to detect diseases,\u201d Berry said. \u201cAnd it turns out that graphene is an extremely versatile and accurate detector of biosignatures of diseases found both in cerebrospinal fluids and whole cells.\u201d Bijentimala Keisham from the UIC College of Engineering; Steven Denyer, Pouyan Kheirkhan, Gregory Arnone, Abhiraj Bhimani and Dr. Ankit Mehta, from the department of neurosurgery in the UIC College of Medicine, Akop Seksenyan from the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, Chicago, and Clive Svendsen from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, are co-authors on the paper.

It is a unique experience that encourages a crucial link between students and faculty. The Resident Faculty work closely with the Residence Life staff to create programs for the residents. Peer Mentors are the heart of our academic services effort. These students of sophomore standing or higher that have great leadership skills and proven academic success guide first-year students through the many different adjustments from the high school to the college experience, and encourage experienced students to become more involved in their academic community. Peer Mentors provide tutoring in our Learning Resource Centers and facilitate study sessions for first-year students. Peer Mentors also provide academic workshops, First Year Experience programming to help new students adapt to college, and individual follow up, referral to resources, and support for students needing additional help. Our Living and Learning Communities (LLC) attract high-achieving students and provide specialized attention for an enriched educational\u00a0experience. They offer a sense of community through programs, conversations, and faculty interaction centered on members\u2019 interests. Learning Resource Centers (LRC) are located in the residence halls and available as areas for one-on-one and group tutoring and study twenty-four hours a day. Peer Mentors offer tutoring in the LRCs most evenings in a range of subjects.

She was a CPS student from Head Start, an early education program for low-income families, through 12th grade, then began her teaching career at Chicago South Shore High School. Since that time, Jackson has served as a principal, network chief, the chief education officer and now as chief executive officer for CPS, the third largest school district in the country. Since assuming the role of chief education officer in 2015, Jackson has focused on building equity, excellence and access across the district, especially with regard to CPS high schools. Jackson is a progressive, forward-thinking educator who believes in setting the bar high. Jackson holds a Master of Education degree with a field of study in leadership and administration, as well as a Doctor of Education degree with a field of study in urban education leadership, both from the University of Illinois at Chicago. UIC:\u00a0To begin, what roles do you envision the UIC College of Education playing to support the CPS\u2019 vision to provide a world-class education for its students? Jackson: Well, I think UIC plays several roles; the first and most notable is to provide teachers for Chicago Public Schools. UIC has provided teachers through a pipeline from its teacher education program for decades and I see that as the most critical support they can give to Chicago Public Schools. Through the Urban Leadership Program in the College of Education, the work they are doing around identifying high-quality principals to lead and transform schools is definitely a game changer for our school system, where we have seen a remarkable turnaround. Just having a place, or destination, for Chicago Public School student graduates. I was at Epic Academy High School on the Southeast Side and met a young lady who was featured on the news for getting more than a million dollars in scholarships, but she\u2019s going to the University of Illinois and when she said that to me, I was so thrilled. UIC: What message would you like to provide to aspiring teachers and administrators at UIC who want to become a part of CPS? Jackson: I think that many of the values that we share as an organization are the same values that UIC possesses, so I think that is a good place to start. One thing that I would say is that for the teacher education programs, we like to see more graduates leaving those programs, working for Chicago Public Schools, and really seeing it as a career and a destination, not just a first stop. I really want to make sure that the program is prioritizing how you help develop teachers who can work in urban school settings and teachers who are going to be able to come in and transform schools through what they do in their classrooms. I think UIC\u2019s principal training program is doing that on a large scale, and I would like to see more and more of that from the teacher program. The advice that I would give them is to look for schools that have effective school leaders. The principal plays a critical role in school transformation and school quality. Oftentimes, especially with new teachers, they select schools for a variety of reasons. I would say the primary thing they should be looking at is school leadership. School leadership is going to determine the support they receive once they become teachers, and it definitely has a correlation to how long they are going to remain teachers. UIC: Can you discuss how the College of Education at UIC prepared you for your role as an instructor and as a school administrator? Jackson: I had a wonderful experience at UIC. When I say that \u2018I am UIC,\u2019 I truly believe that. In addition, I learned a lot in my master\u2019s program as I was getting my certification and master\u2019s degree to be a school leader and principal. This notion, which is commonplace now, that principals are instructional leaders, was new back in the early 2000s when I was in that program. It really shaped my identity as a school leader and administrator. Operational and communication skills are critically important when you lead a community. What UIC taught me is the importance of being an instructional leader and that the principal is the lead learner in every school building. Your major focus has to be on developing the capacity of others and that makes the school better in so many different ways. I would say that is the biggest impact of what I learned at UIC. Also at UIC, having access to some of the best professors in the country is definitely an added benefit. UIC\u2019s Urban Educational Institute for School Leadership is one of the most renowned programs in the country. People come from all over to see what UIC is doing to produce principals. I am just lucky to be one of those former principals, who is now leading a district where we have access to that pipeline because I really believe they are developing people who can go to any school and turn it around. UIC: How did the Urban Education Leadership Doctorate Program prepare you for your role as Chicago Public Schools chief executive officer? Jackson: This notion of \u2018continuous improvement\u2019 is a big part of the UIC motto. Even when you succeed and you hit a goal, the next one is always there and you should have your eye on trying to continue to improve. The program teaches you how to do that in a very practical and scalable way. I have been in and known of programs that are well defined and well designed, but they are all theory. Sometimes practitioners may be somewhat familiar with the research but not immersed in it, or there are people who know the research front-and-back but they are practicing it. UIC does an excellent job of marrying theory and practice, and oftentimes, there is not that marriage. What you see from leaders who have gone through UIC\u2019s program is that they understand both the theory and the practical implications of the work. I love policy and I am a policy wonk. A lot of that was cultivated and developed in the UIC studies program centered on urban leadership that taught us different frameworks and how you look at policy and analyze it, and how you create it and implement it. I think I bring many of those tools to this role. One of the first things that I changed when I became chief education officer was to think about the ways we change policy here in the district. UIC really provided us with a lot of research and frameworks around how to get buy-in from people on the ground. As CEO, one of my goals is to make sure that we operate as a full district, not a set of individual schools. There is no better way to do that than making sure that the leaders at the school level are involved in policy creation, formation and implementation. That is something that is a direct result of my participation in the UIC program. UIC: This year, UIC announced the Chancellor Fellows Aim High initiative, which offers incoming high achieving high school students an opportunity to have their tuition and fees paid for if they stay in state, and the Call Me MISTER program, which is designed to increase the percentage of male teachers of color teaching in elementary schools. How do you think recent initiatives undertaken at UIC will help draw more CPS graduates? Jackson: I believe the two initiatives show a commitment by UIC leadership to try and attract a diverse group of students. The UIC Chancellor\u2019s Fellows Program, which is designed to recruit and retain highly qualified students from Illinois by offering full tuition, will be very attractive to high-achieving CPS graduates, many of whom will be the first in their family to attend college. UIC\u2019s Call Me MISTER program is another initiative that is desperately needed. The program offers students pursuing approved programs of study in urban teacher education the opportunity to receive full tuition, as well as room and board with the aim of teaching in the classroom. With only 2 percent of teachers in American public grade schools being black males, there is a huge need for these male role models in the classroom at CPS, as well as other school districts, and UIC is helping to fill the need. UIC: As an alumna, please complete the following: The UIC College of Education is\u2026 Jackson: Amazing. I truly owe everything that I am from a leadership perspective to the program. I definitely think I brought many natural attributes there. I was developing nicely prior to going into the UIC programs, but I definitely feel like it strengthened me as a leader. I draw on so many of the things that I learned in both programs every single day in this role as chief executive officer. I would just say that it was an amazing experience, and I made the right choice going to UIC. \n\nContact\n\nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n\n\n \nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n Categories \nAlumni, Campus, Faculty, Students  Topics alumni, College of Education Carlos Sadovi | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/colleges-schools/education/urban-ed-lead/", "https://education.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/uics-chancellors-fellows-program-targets-stellar-illinois-students", "https://today.uic.edu/call-me-mister-initiative-comes-to-uic-to-train-more-teachers-of-color", "https://today.uic.edu/author/csadovi", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-alumni", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-faculty", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/alumni", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-education", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/college-of-engineerings-first-female-graduate": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDecember 6, 2018\t\t\t Nancy Holmes, the first female graduate from the UIC College of Engineering. En Espa\u00f1ol Today, about 25 percent of workers in STEM careers \u2014 those involving science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 are women. But back in 1968, when Nancy Holmes was the first woman to earn a degree in engineering from the UIC College of Engineering, the percentage of women in science or engineering careers was diminishingly small. For Holmes, who grew up in Oak Park, the probability that she would go into the sciences was high from the start \u2014 several uncles and her grandfather were civil engineers, her brother is an architectural engineer, her father was an engineer at Zenith Radio and two aunts had advanced math degrees. Her mother had a job in hospital nutrition and was well-versed in chemistry. So, when her high school dean asked what she wanted to major in for college, she said engineering without hesitation. She began her freshman year in the fall of 1958 at the Urbana-Champaign campus. \u201cWhen classes started, I soon realized that all of my classmates in engineering would be male,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in an engineering class with a female until my last class as a graduate student.\u201d For the most part, Holmes said, the men in her classes and her teachers treated her with respect. She married her husband, Tom, in 1959. Soon, they added two daughters to the family, and Holmes spent the next nine years working on her degree while raising her children and participating in suburban life. From 1959 through 1961, she took classes at the University of Illinois Navy Pier campus. In 1961, she spent six weeks in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp near Blackduck, Minnesota, for her required course in surveying. She was the only woman in her barracks. She remembers that her male classmates treated her very politely, if formally at first, but later they got along as friendly colleagues. In 1965, Holmes went back to the UIC campus, which was known then as the Circle Campus, and had just opened. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in structural engineering and materials science in 1968, her master\u2019s degree in materials engineering in 1970, and her Ph.D. in engineering in 1976. She was the first woman to earn each of these degrees from the UIC College of Engineering. She will return to campus Dec. 15 to celebrate with fellow Golden Grads \u2014 members of the Class of 1968 \u2014 at commencement. Holmes, 77, worked at Sargent & Lundy, a Chicago engineering firm serving the power industry, from 1976 to 2018. She helped develop computer programs used to determine the magnitude and effects of loads on structures in nuclear and fossil fuel plants caused by earthquakes. She also supervised work on computer programs for soil structure interactions, the generation of response spectra, and analysis of HVAC hangers and piping systems. Holmes insists that engineering is a great profession for women. \u201cWhen I started college, typical choices for women were general liberal arts, teaching, home economics, journalism, and for the very daring, business or science,\u201d she said. \u201cVery few of us expected to have a career. We expected to work a few years and get married and then stay home with the children, but many of us soon discovered that we would be working for some time of our lives. If only more women realized what a challenging and financially rewarding career engineering provides, I think there would be more women in this field.\u201d Holmes has been an active member of Engineers Without Borders for many years, and has traveled to Guatemala and Honduras to help develop bridges and sanitation systems. She established the Nancy Anderson Holmes scholarship in 2006 in memory of her aunt, which benefits UIC civil engineering students. She received the Legacy Alumni Achievement Award from the UIC College of Engineering in November. Holmes lives in Oak Park with her husband, Tom. They have three children, 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \n\nContact\n\nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nAlumni, Campus \n \nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n Categories \nAlumni, Campus  Topics alumni, commencement, engineering, Golden Grad, graduation, women in engineering En Espa\u00f1ol Sharon Parmet | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/20181107_collegeofengineeringdinner_088-2", "https://today.uic.edu/la-graduada-dorada-nancy-holmes", "https://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-alumni", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/alumni", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/commencement", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/engineering", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/golden-grad", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/graduation", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/women-in-engineering", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/oasis-use-policy": {"text": "\u00a9 Copyright 2013-2018 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois  ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/search/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/ulist/az", "http://library.uic.edu/", "https://ocle.uic.edu", "https://ocle.uic.edu/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/classroom-renovations/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/learning-space-design-standards/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/upcoming-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/completed-projects-2/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/giving-to-project-oasis-2/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis/proposed-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/current-and-recent-projects/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/list-of-oases-and-learning-centers/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/oasis-location-map/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/project-oasis-guidlines/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/oasis-use-policy/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/your-oasis-experience-video-contest-winners/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/assessment/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/active-learning-environments/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/news/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/advisory-board/", "https://ocle.uic.edu/contact-us/", "http://ocle.publish.uic.edu/list-of-oases-and-learning-centers/", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/studentservices/disability.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/campus/emergency-information.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/photo-video-policies": {"text": "Due to concerns for federal privacy regulations (FERPA and HIPAA), at all times other than designated public events, photography (including video) that is not official business of the university is forbidden in university buildings unless the photographer is accompanied by Public Affairs.

The seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change (CCUSC) collaborate on this project with program infrastructure provided by the Latino Cultural Center. The internship program is funded by the UIC Sustainability Fee. All project efforts are carried out through the activities of the Internship Program. One of the ways in which we document our internship activities is through photography. Currently there are 8 satellite gardens on UIC's East campus. Garden interns research the cultural significance of the plants in the garden. Check out the plants we have at the garden as well as other interesting research projects. We collect stories from family, friends, and community members about environmentally friendly practices and heritage plants. We engage students, faculty, staff, and community members on issues of environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, and social justice. We work with local artists to make creative and explicit expressions on environmental and cultural sustainability. We collect seeds from our garden satellites, local gardeners, and gardens around the globe.

This is a living document based on the values of UIC and best practices for the creation and delivery of information on the web that will change as UIC explores new services, systems and strategies. Look for more information on generating content within the Red WordPress multisite? A companion UIC Web Content Style Guide can be found here.\u00a0 This style guide provides a navigation map on content creation and maintenance, writing for the web and other best practices for web elements. User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence. All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data. Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved. The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills, backgrounds and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services. The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience. The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability. The web presence operates on evidence-based best practices through both original research with our users and external sources (e.g.,Nielsen Norman group articles). The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of UIC resources and services to our users. The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University, in Chicago and with communities throughout the State, the Midwest region and beyond. The web presence protects and upholds the University\u2019s commitment to maintain the privacy of users of University websites. All sites on the Red Network are GDPR compliant, with a floating cookie notification banner that automatically appears on the bottom of the page. The UIC web presence should provide: The audiences we serve include: Web content is not the same as print content. Web content is much more than copy\u2014it also includes images, media, interactive elements, structural and navigational elements, and metadata. We design, iteratively test and improve our web content based on best practices and web standards. Good content design always starts with user needs. Every piece of content (and every system and service) should exist based on an end-user persona and a valid, actionable user need. Personas are an archetype for a broad user group. Every piece of content should identify one user persona who represents their primary audience. \u201cAnyone\u201d = \u201cno one.\u201d A valid user need does not assume a solution or a tool. First identify the need, then design a solution based on that need. User needs are based on evidence from analytics or user research. User needs also must be based on actions or tasks, following this template: As a [persona], I need to [actionable task], so I can [desired outcome]. Good example: As an undergraduate student (persona), I need to find my academic program requirements (task), so I can complete my degree in four years (desired outcome). Bad example: As an undergraduate student, I need to use the course catalog (tool assumed), so I know what courses you have (not actionable). Content should be easy to read and easy to use, following best practices for web writing and formatting. Usable interfaces only work if they contain usable content. Language should not exceed an 8th-grade reading level and should be free of jargon and unclear acronyms. In our diverse campuses, it is especially important to use plain language, as many of our students do not speak English as their first language. Every piece of content should clearly and concisely convey what the user needs to do to meet their need. Even informational content should clearly indicate what the user can \u201cdo\u201d with the information. Content that is infrequently maintained will become inaccurate. We regularly review our content to ensure that it is timely and correct. Our services should not exclude any user based on ability. We create web content that meets accessibility standards and considers all user needs. Web content should meet Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) standards. HTML is more accessible than embedded documents. When documents are absolutely necessary, use an accessible PDF format. When writing content about our services, use inclusive language and consider user needs based on ability. For example, if writing about visiting a classroom location, include relevant information about accessible transit options, accessible parking and elevators. Our content and services should be findable, on our website and across the Web. Put the right content in the right web property and deliver it when it\u2019s most useful to our users. Content should live \u2013 and be maintained \u2013 in one place and shared across all of our platforms. This ensures that information is consistent. Example: Approved course descriptions appear in the course catalog. Do not recreate content on individual sites which can become out-of-sync; link to original source. Consistent labels that use plain language will help users find content on our site, in search engines and at times, in our physical spaces. Using appropriate formatting and web elements, such as headings and bullets, will help users easily scan content on our site, and search engines will be able identify important pieces of information. Design and content strategy cannot succeed without a governance structure that ensures the web presence is meeting goals and standards. All UIC faculty, staff and students are stakeholders in UIC\u2019s web presence and are encouraged to share feedback and participate in usability testing and design activities. The following departments and committees are responsible for design, content, functionality and usability assessment efforts for the UIC web presence. The UIC Office of Digital Communications oversees adherence to brand, accessibility and usability standards; coordinates, approves and facilitates development on the code base; and manages creation and deployment of websites on the RED WordPress multisite. The office also provides user support and training. ACCC provides and maintains the systems and support for the hosting, user management and integrations with other UIC systems of the RED WordPress multisite. The UIC Office of Marketing and Brand Management sets the branding guidelines for the University. All primary web properties must conform to these guidelines, and secondary properties should conform whenever possible. The Web Advisory Committee is comprised of representatives from all UIC colleges and vice chancellor offices to inform and recommend enhancements and improvements to the design and function of the RED WordPress multisite based on the needs of site users and content creators.

In order for content to be useful, usable, accessible and findable, we must deliberately plan for the full lifecycle of content and services and build in assessment at each step. This lifecycle and the workflows involved in each phase are outlined below. Content and services can range from small scale projects, such as the addition of a new section on a web page, to large scale content review and revision for an individual site. The planning process can take anywhere from a few minutes for a small blurb on a web page, to a few months or years for a large scale web project. If content does not meet content design principles or if there is no longer a primary stakeholder to manage it, it will be withdrawn. Content authors directly edit content on a web property. They are required to uphold the Content Strategy and Web Style Guide, and participate in regular content assessment. Content authors must also complete a minimum level of training in writing for the web and using the content management platform on which they create content. Within a web property, content authors may have different levels of roles and permissions, and some authors may have additional editorial responsibilities to approve and publish the work of other authors. Content authors may also have different roles in different web properties. Content author roles are set by the site owner. Every piece of content should have a content owner who is responsible for maintaining it through its full lifecycle. A web property owner assigns content ownership. If a department, committee or working group is the content owner, the chair or head will be ultimately responsible for the content. Web property owners lead efforts to maintain and create all content on the site. They set content authoring permissions, assign ownership of content, and lead regular content review efforts. A site owner may be one person or the chairs of a working group or committee. Guiding principles for the UIC web presence are: User needs drive all of the content and services that make up the web presence. All web content and services are regularly assessed through user testing and use data. Areas of the web presence that do not meet the standards of our users are retired or improved. The web presence respects and builds upon the varied skills, backgrounds, and experiences of its diverse users through inclusive language and services. The tone of all web content should be friendly and easily understandable to a diverse audience. The web presence works to ensure equal access to information by providing services that meet or exceed standards for accessibility and usability. The web presence operates on evidence-based best practices and original research with our users. The web presence employs innovative new services and information practices that improve the online delivery of Library resources and services to our users. The web presence consists of services that engage with users and collaborators in the University, in Chicago, and with communities throughout the State, the Midwest region, and beyond. The web presence protects and upholds the University\u2019s commitment to maintain the privacy of users of University websites. For each piece of content, ask: Structure your content so that users can find the answers to their questions quickly. Summarize the essential information first, then reveal the information that supports it. Our voice is our unique personality. Just as a person\u2019s voice remains largely the same, so should the voice of our web presence. A well-crafted voice communicates our personality and values. UIC\u2019s voice is described in the UIC Style Guide under Lexicon. Tone is more like attitude \u2014 the emotional context of a piece. Just as a person\u2019s tone of voice changes to fit the somberness or lightness of a situation, so can the tone of writing used throughout our web presence. To connect with people and show you care, you have to meet your users where they are. Think about the situation your readers are in. What did they come here for? Blog posts can be personal and casual, but if you\u2019re writing a technical document to help someone troubleshoot, you probably need to take on an instructional tone. You can be a little more dramatic or persuasive in a marketing campaign than in your help center. Above all, when you\u2019re thinking about tone, consider the context of the message. For example, if you\u2019re giving directions, you can naturally assume that readers need help finding their way. The next step is to think about your reader\u2019s emotional state. Try to understand their frame of mind and talk to them where they are. Find out what happens just before your message appears. Is this good news that will make readers feel happy, relieved, or excited, or is it bad news that will make them frustrated, angry, or upset? Will the message brighten their day, or put them in a difficult situation? Are readers prepared, or will they be caught off guard? These questions will help you decide how to write the message. View each accordion below for guidelines on how to describe people\u00a0(from the MailChimp Content Style Guide. Remember, words matter. Additional information on the power of language is provided by the UIC Office of Diversity. Don\u2019t reference a person\u2019s age unless it\u2019s relevant to what you\u2019re writing. If it is relevant, include the person\u2019s specific age, offset by commas: The CEO, 16, just got her drivers license. Don\u2019t refer to people using age-related descriptors like \u201cyoung,\u201d \u201cold,\u201d or \u201celderly.\u201d Don\u2019t refer to a person\u2019s disability unless it\u2019s relevant to what you\u2019re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: \u201cshe has a disability\u201d rather than \u201cshe is disabled.\u201d When writing about a person with disabilities, don\u2019t use the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cvictim,\u201d or \u201chandicapped.\u201d \u201cHandicapped parking\u201d is OK. Don\u2019t call groups of people \u201cguys.\u201d Don\u2019t call women \u201cgirls.\u201d Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like \u201cserver\u201d instead of \u201cwaitress\u201d and \u201cbusinessperson\u201d instead of \u201cbusinessman.\u201d It\u2019s OK to use \u201cthey\u201d as a singular pronoun. Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns: When writing about a person, use their preferred pronouns. If you\u2019re uncertain, just use their name. Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer. In quotations and the formal names of organizations and events, other forms such as LGBTQIA(+) and other variations are also acceptable with the other letters explained. I generally stands for intersex, and A can stand for allies (a person who is not LGBT but who actively supports the LGBT community), asexual (a person who doesn\u2019t experience sexual attraction) or both. The plus represents other identities that may fall under the umbrella.The word queer has been reclaimed by many LGBTQIA+ communities, but may be considered a slur in some contexts, so limit use of the word to quotes and names of organizations, following rules for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. Note that sex, gender and sexual orientation are not synonymous. Use \u201cdeaf\u201d as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use \u201cpartially deaf\u201d or \u201chard of hearing.\u201d Don\u2019t refer to a person\u2019s medical condition unless it\u2019s relevant to what you\u2019re writing. If a reference to a person\u2019s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don\u2019t call a person with a medical condition a \u201cvictim.\u201d Don\u2019t refer to a person\u2019s mental or cognitive condition unless it\u2019s relevant to what you\u2019re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition. Don\u2019t describe a person as \u201cmentally ill.\u201d If a reference to a person\u2019s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first. Use the adjective \u201cblind\u201d to describe a person who is unable to see. Use \u201clow vision\u201d to describe a person with limited vision. Alt text is a way to label images, and it\u2019s especially important for people who can\u2019t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two. Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles. It\u2019s OK to use an ampersand in button copy. Standard website buttons include: Use sentence case for checkboxes. Use title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items. Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form. Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields. Keep forms as short as possible. Only request information that we need and intend to use. Don\u2019t ask for information that could be considered private or personal, including gender. If you need to ask for gender, provide a field the user can fill in on their own, not a drop-down menu. When writing microcopy on forms (i.e explanatory or instructional text that accompanies fields), be clear and concise. Microcopy should lend direction. Consider writing it an opportunity to further build a relationship with the user. Headings and subheadings organize content for readers. Be generous and descriptive. Headings (H1) give people a taste of what they\u2019re about to read. Use them for page and blog titles. Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable. Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H2 under H3, and on down.) Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content. Use title case for titles (H1), unless the heading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case. Use sentence case (H2, H3, etc.) for subheadings regardless of end punctuation. Provide a link whenever you\u2019re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources. Don\u2019t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example: Yes: Read the automation guide for details. No: Read the automation guide for details. If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don\u2019t link the punctuation mark. Don\u2019t say things like \u201cClick here!\u201d or \u201cClick for more information\u201d or \u201cRead this.\u201d Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords. Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they\u2019re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you\u2019re describing steps of a process. Don\u2019t use numbers when the list\u2019s order doesn\u2019t matter. If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don\u2019t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item. Your main or global navigation is used to guide site visitors around your website. It should contain ONLY internal links to your site pages. External links to other websites, including other UIC sites, can appear in eyebrow or footer menus, but not your main/global navigation menu. Use title case for main or global navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation. Navigation links should be clear and concise. Use title case for headings and sentence case for button fields. Linked articles should appear in a logical order, following the step down/step up rule: The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article. The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article. Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows. Titles are (you guessed it) in title case. Don\u2019t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question. Use these terms with caution. Be specific on first reference so that users know meaning when abbreviations or terms are used in subsequent text.

The native of northern Greece was himself a first-generation college student, who came to the U.S. to pursue graduate studies in chemical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to his becoming UIC chancellor in March 2015, Amiridis spent over two decades as a professor, researcher and senior administrator at the University of South Carolina. He calls UIC \u201ca model of a public urban research institution in this country, located in a most vibrant global city.\u201d \u201cI believe with its rich history of success in high quality education, in the creation and application of new knowledge, and with its unique strengths in the health sciences and in community engagement, access and inclusion, UIC is well-positioned for the future,\u201d he said. As UIC\u2019s chancellor, Amiridis heads Chicago\u2019s largest university campus, with 30,000 students. The campus ranks 58th in federal research funding. UIC has a nearly $2 billion budget, 12,000 faculty and staff, and 15 academic colleges, including the nation\u2019s largest medical school.

To be truly transformative, shared responsibility for diversity cannot be hierarchical and dependent upon higher authority. It must occur at all levels of operations, be engaged, and undertaken by all levels of faculty, staff, students, and administrators. Diversity cuts across disciplines, departments, functions, and administrative units. It transforms practitioners into leaders, increasing the sustainability of diversity priorities despite any change in university, campus, or diversity leadership. Institutional Responsibility Implements policies, practices, and procedures that further campus diversity goals; accepts and reinforces accountability in leadership. Individual Responsibility Essential to creating a culture in which all members of the UIC community understand, accept, and exercise their responsibilities for diversity and equity.

With the new four-year award, they will continue to test this system, which is capable of analyzing significantly more strains in less time than other techniques, on environmental bacteria and build the library. They will also further test their web-based software, which is called IDBac. The software has been designed to analyze large sets of data, to identify the differences and similarities between the bacteria in the database, and to represent the information visually. \u201cWe are building a \u2018smart\u2019 library for drug discovery,\u201d said Brian Murphy, associate professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy, and one of three principal investigators of the project. \u201cUsing our tools, we want to enable researchers from all over the world to more efficiently study bacteria \u2014 to know what type of bacteria they have discovered and to know what kind of weapon it will produce.\u201d UIC\u2019s Laura Sanchez and Isabel Cruz are the other principal investigators on the project. Sanchez\u2019s work on this project focuses on the development of the mass spectrometry-based analysis. \u201cApplications of mass spectrometry are rapidly expanding, particularly for biological systems,\u201d said Sanchez, assistant professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy at the UIC College of Pharmacy. \u201cOur platform is unique in its ability to integrate two different types of data sets which will maximize the diversity of bacteria represented in our library and exponentially grow its utility.\u201d Cruz, professor of computer science at the UIC College of Engineering, is spearheading efforts to harness Big Data concepts, including search, classification and information visualization. William Metcalf of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a collaborator on the project. Metcalf, the G. William Arends Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and professor of microbiology at the U. of I. \u00a0School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, is donating cellular material from the Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection for digitization into the library. The ARS collection, which contains more than 8,000 strains and is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is one of the largest public collections of microorganisms in the world. \u201cWe hope that we can create a more targeted, cost-efficient and accessible approach to microbial drug discovery,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis would be a major innovation to the front end of drug discovery research when scientists need basic information to begin studying microbial strains for disease-fighting properties.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n\n\n \nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n Categories \nFeatured Academic Research, Research  Topics bacteria, College of Engineering, College of Pharmacy, drug discovery, East Meets West, research Jacqueline Carey | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/building-a-public-library-of-bacteria-to-facilitate-drug-discovery-research/33894910235_98b4bdcc4b_o", "https://today.uic.edu/author/jmcarey", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-acadresearch", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/bacteria", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-engineering", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-pharmacy", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/drug-discovery", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/east-meets-west", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/research", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/uic-wins-mellon-grants-to-fund-undergraduate-humanities-research-latino-doctoral-studies": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 17, 2018\t\t\t The University of Illinois at Chicago has received two grants totaling nearly $1.9 million from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to fund expanded opportunity for undergraduate research in the humanities and to assist doctoral candidates in Latino humanities studies. UIC Provost Susan Poser As part of the Engaged Humanities Initiative, or EHI, the university will receive $1 million over four and a half years to teach and mentor undergraduate students to explore and conduct research in the humanities at UIC. The initiative will be based in the UIC Institute for the Humanities where students who are part of EHI will have the opportunity to meet with mentors, attend lectures and workshops, and engage in professional development. UIC faculty will teach seminars that introduce students to the humanities and guide them in learning research methods and developing research topics. Faculty will also mentor students who are preparing for graduate school and other careers that will draw on their humanities education. Because students attending UIC hail from such diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds, UIC Provost Susan Poser, who is also the principal investigator on the grant, expects that the topics they choose as research projects will reflect this diversity and expand the type and scope of research that students choose to pursue. \u201cThis in turn will encourage faculty to explore how humanities education and pedagogy can adapt to become more connected to, and inclusive of, the lives of this generation of students. Long term, this program will help UIC become a model of humanities education for the 21st century,\u201d said Poser. Maria de los Angeles Torres, IUPLR executive director and UIC professor. Photo: Jenny Fontaine In addition to this 3-year grant, the Inter-University Program for Latino Research \u2013 a UIC based national Latino research consortium \u2014 has received an $884,088 grant from the Mellon Foundation to continue its efforts to support doctoral students working in Latino humanities. The initiative previously received an $800,000 grant from Mellon. The grant is part of the efforts of the Inter-University Program for Latino Research to develop a national fellowship program designed to mentor Latino studies scholars as they complete their doctoral research and improve their job-market readiness. The latest grant will go to help six fellows chosen every year from the consortium\u2019s centers, including UIC, to complete their dissertation in Latino studies in the humanities, said Maria de los Angeles Torres, professor of Latin American and Latino studies and the executive director of the consortium. \u201cThe goal is to maximize swift and effective progress to complete the PhD, increase job market readiness and introduce students to a variety of potential jobs,\u201d said Torres, who is the principal investigator on the grant. One of those people who benefited was Jose Castellanos, who received his doctorate during the 2016-2017 school year and is currently teaching at Loyola University in Chicago. \u201cThe fellowship has literally changed my life,\u201d said Castellanos. \u201cLike the fellowship did for me, I have the opportunity to help students who just need a little push and a little extra help to graduate.\u201d Joining Poser on the Engaged Humanities Initiative grant proposal was Astrida Tantillo, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; Mark Canuel, professor and director of the UIC Institute for the Humanities; and Sara Hall, Associate Professor of Germanic studies and Director, Office of Undergraduate Research. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nContact\n\nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n\n\n \nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n Categories \nFeatured Academic Research  Carlos Sadovi | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/events/provosts-office-hours/susan-poser1116-1", "https://today.uic.edu/experts/maria-de-los-angeles-torres/maria-de-los-angeles-torres-2", "http://iuplr.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/author/csadovi", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-acadresearch", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://archive.news.uic.edu": {"text": "UIC PHYSICIAN WINS PRESTIGIOUS ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION AWARD   ", "out_links": ["http://news.uic.edu", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/search/", "http://www.uic.edu/htbin/ulist/az", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/about/visit/directions.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/studentservices/disability.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/studentlife/campus/emergency-information.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/about/jobopenings/index.shtml", "http://www.uic.edu", "http://www.uic.edu/uic/about/leadership/index.shtml", "http://exedweb.cc.uic.edu/uiconline/uic_online.asp", "http://www.uic.edu/depts/dos/veteranaffairs.html"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/teaching-antibiotics-to-be-more-effective-killers": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDecember 11, 2017\t\t\t Research shows prolonged inhibition of protein synthesis leads to cell death. Photo: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) Research from the University of Illinois at Chicago suggests bond duration, not bond tightness, may be the most important differentiator between antibiotics that kill bacteria and antibiotics that only stop bacterial growth. While both types of antibiotics are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, bactericidal antibiotics \u2013 those that kill bacteria \u2013 can be taken for shorter periods, are associated with a lower risk of infection recurrence and often cure the infection much better than bacteriostatic antibiotics. \u201cBacteriostatic antibiotics work by slowing the growth of bacterial cells while the individual\u2019s immune system fights the infection,\u201d said Alexander Mankin, lead author of the study and director of the Center for Biomolecular Sciences in the UIC College of Pharmacy. \u201cOften, this is enough to treat an infection; but if the immune system is not strong enough, the infection may persist.\u201d Unfortunately, not much is known about why the sometimes-similar antibiotic molecules interact differently with bacteria in the body. Mankin and his colleagues looked at one class of antibiotics called macrolides, which work by binding to the ribosome of the bacteria to stop protein synthesis. However, while macrolide antibiotics are all structurally similar and act on the same molecular target (the ribosome), some are bactericidal and others are bacteriostatic. Using a new technique developed by Maxim Svetlov, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Mankin and Nora V\u00e1zquez-Laslop, an associate professor in the center, the researchers studied the differences between the bacteriostatic and bactericidal macrolides. The technique makes it possible to analyze how tightly the drugs interact with the ribosome and to measure the speed with which the antibiotics can disconnect from the target. \u201cResearchers usually think that it is the tightness of the drug\u2019s binding to the ribosome that makes the difference between an antibiotic that kills bacteria and one that only slows bacterial growth,\u201d Mankin said. \u201cTherefore, we were surprised to find that tightness of the drug binding does not define the ability of the drug to kill bacteria. \u201cInstead we understood that bactericidal drugs dissociate from the ribosome at a significantly slower rate,\u201d Mankin said. The presence of an extended side chain in the structure of the antibiotic functions \u201clike an extra hand to hold on to the ribosome; it allows the drug to bind for a longer period,\u201d says Mankin. The findings, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offer a new and previously unexplored possibility. \u201cThe results of this study suggest that when we talk about the mechanism of antibiotic action, we need to talk about more than \u2018how tight\u2019 a drug binds,\u201d Mankin said. \u201cWe also need to talk about kinetics and the rate of a drug\u2019s disassociation from the ribosome.\u201d In addition to improving outcomes for individuals who need antibiotic treatment, particularly for patients who are immunocompromised, understanding the difference between bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics may also help to address the problem of rising antibiotic resistance in society. \u201cIf we can understand these mechanisms, we may be able to reduce the rate at which antibiotic resistance develops and repeat infections occur,\u201d Mankin said. Sveltov and V\u00e1zquez-Laslop are co-authors on the paper. A grant from the National Institutes of Health (RO1 GM106386) supported the study. \n\nContact\n\nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n\n\n \nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n Categories \nFeatured Academic Research, Research  Topics antibiotics, Center for Biomolecular Sciences, College of Pharmacy, research Jacqueline Carey | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/teaching-antibiotics-to-be-more-effective-killers/figure6", "https://today.uic.edu/author/jmcarey", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-acadresearch", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/antibiotics", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/center-for-biomolecular-sciences", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-pharmacy", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/research", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/cuban-delegation-uic-work-toward-better-womens-health-in-englewood": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNovember 13, 2017\t\t\t Cuban physicians visit the UI Health Mile Square Health Center in Englewood. Four physicians from Cuba are working in Chicago to improve maternal health and birth outcomes in Englewood. Through a partnership\u00a0with the University of Illinois at Chicago, the physicians have been observing clinical care at Mile Square Health Center, UI Health\u2019s network of federally qualified clinics. They have also met with community leaders, including elected officials, nonprofit groups and others, to develop a picture of how health care is delivered in under-resourced communities, and how their expertise may help fill gaps in care. \u201cThe Cuban health system does preventive health very, very well, and they do it without a lot of money,\u201d said Dr. Robert Winn, associate vice chancellor of community-based practice at UIC and director of the University of Illinois Cancer Center. Per capita, Cuba spent roughly $600 on health expenditures in 2010. In the U.S., this figure is above $8,000 for the same year, but life expectancy in the two countries was the same, at 79 years. En Espa\u00f1ol For the past year, doctors from Cuba and researchers from the cancer center have traveled between the two countries to observe practices and exchange ideas. During the exchange, the team identified a key difference between the two countries: doctors in the U.S. do not know as much about their patients\u2019 home life and environment. In Cuba, doctors have more insight into how the home and neighborhood affects their patients\u2019 health. \u201cIn Cuba, we visit every home and we ask health-related questions for every individual in the household,\u201d said Dr. Jose Armando Arronte Villamarin, one of the physicians from Cuba who has been in Chicago since August. \u201cThe assessment we use gives us a comprehensive picture of overall health and health risk in different communities, and it helps us focus on addressing community level public health concerns.\u201d The health situation assessment tool is the cornerstone of preventive health throughout Cuban communities. In Cuba, the assessment includes questions about health \u2014 weight, exercise and medical symptoms, for example \u2014 but also an environmental analysis. Physicians in Cuba want to know if their communities have access to clean drinking water and affordable food and transportation, for example. While in the homes, doctors and nurses, with the help of medical students, can quickly assess for other factors that impact health \u2014 like allergens and dust that may trigger respiratory conditions in children, such as asthma or SIDS \u2014 or affect risk of accidents. Based on the assessment, physicians allocate their limited resources accordingly. If a community is composed of primarily young families, physicians may invest in vaccination and family-planning resources; if a significant population of the community is older, physicians may bring in resources to help minimize falls, fight cancer or facilitate transportation to medical appointments. If a community has an overabundance of standing water, mosquito remediation spraying may be ordered for that location. Kathy Tossas-Milligan, an epidemiologist, says that there is no process or individual-level assessment like this in the U.S. \u201cIn the U.S., we rely on random epidemiologic samples that aggregate community-level data,\u201d said Tossas-Milligan, director of global assets and innovative approaches at the UI Cancer Center. \u201cWhile this is good information for academic and provider reporting, it does not provide adequate information for addressing barriers and taking action.\u201d UI Health Mile Square Health Center at Englewood Learning from the Cubans and their successful experience with the health assessment, the cancer center team at UI Health is adapting the questionnaire to a U.S. audience and testing it in Chicago\u2019s Englewood neighborhood, which is home to roughly 25,000 Chicagoans. In Englewood, life expectancy is well below the national average at only 72 years, based on 2014 data. The average in Chicago is 77 years, and 79 years in the U.S. Englewood is a predominantly black community with most households headed by single females. Compared with citywide rates, residents of Englewood experience four times the homicide rate and double the rate of infant mortality. Infant mortality rates are already three times higher for black babies in the U.S. than white or Latino babies. The pilot project will test the adapted health situation analysis with up to 100 reproductive age women (ages 18 to 49) and their families in Englewood. Researchers will connect with women through the Mile Square Health Center clinic in Englewood or community organizations. Women engaged in the pilot will be scheduled for a home health analysis visit, the first of its kind in the U.S. The\u00a0Cuban physicians will consult with the researchers, who have been working with the Cubans since their arrival in early fall. The researchers will use the assessment to get an individual- and community-level picture of overall health, and to note the social and environmental factors that affect health and health behavior. The goal is to use the information as a foundation for enhancing provider awareness of home life and environments, and for addressing maternal health and infant mortality outcomes, such as low birth rate and pre-term births. The researchers plan to attach the information to the electronic health record and use it as the catalysts for a community debate. Following the assessment, women and families in the pilot will be stratified into one of four groups based on health risk. As practiced in Cuba, they will be recommended for a range of home and office visits based on their health assessments. For example, those assigned to a group of participants who are presumed healthy, will be recommended for one office consult. Up to three home or office visits will be recommended based on risk factors, diseases and disabilities. Villamarin, Dr. Berta Maria Bello Rodriguez, Dr. Sonia Maria Gonzalez Vega and Nemesis Perez Martinez, a nurse, are scheduled to be in Chicago through December. A $1 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation funds the project. \n\nContact\n\nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n\n\n \nJacqueline

Dupuis-Devlin) A multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago has published the first quantitative study on the divergent scopes of practice for nurses and doctors. The study uniquely leveraged computer science technology to compare individual-level patient care provided by nurses and doctors using information routinely documented in the electronic health record. The researchers analyzed the electronic health records of 58 randomly selected patients who had a medical diagnosis of heart failure and sought care at a single academic medical center over the course of eight years. Each health record included a physician discharge summary, and nursing plans of care were created for the study using the information found in the discharge report. A computer algorithm developed at UIC was used to identify the key biomedical terms used in each summary and to link synonyms or related terms via a graph traversal \u2014 a network representation that shows the integrated relationships of language and health terminology. The researchers found that only 26 percent of patient records showed an overlap in terms. On average, only four terms between the professions were related to the same concept. Physicians typically used about 27 terms and nurses about 18 terms. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a more unified picture of health care professionals\u2019 perspectives on their patients,\u201d said corresponding author Andrew Boyd, assistant professor of biomedical and health information sciences in the UIC College of Applied Health Sciences. \u201cPrevious studies on this topic have been limited by their reliance on qualitative, observation-based data collection or costly survey methods \u2014 ours is the first to objectively measure the scope of practice when nurses and doctors care for the same patients.\u201d Karen Dunn Lopez (Photo: Mark Mershon) Co-author Karen Dunn Lopez, assistant professor in the UIC College of Nursing, says the findings help to illustrate how nurses and doctors focus on different aspects of patient care. The findings also show that synergy between the two groups is needed to achieve the best possible patient outcomes, she says. \u201cPatients who are hospitalized need hands-on nursing care in addition to the treatments ordered by a physician,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThis is the first evidence of its kind that illustrates how the scope of nursing practice runs parallel to, but independent of, \u2018doctor\u2019s orders.'\u201d Some of the common terms for doctors were highly technical, including \u201cdecreased translucency\u201d and \u201cradiographic examination abnormal,\u201d where nursing terms were more likely to focus on symptoms and responses to illness, such as \u201cacute onset of pain.\u201d While the researchers did not expect the language across professions to be identical, they were surprised to see such significant differences emerge based on documentation review alone. \u201cThe collaboration between nurses and doctors is unique in a modern setting in which multiple nurses work with multiple doctors over the course of the numerous shift changes,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cBecause providers are changing, the dynamics of collaboration are also changing \u2014 this underscores the importance of the electronic health record as perhaps the single most important communication tool used to coordinate care across disciplines in hospitals today,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cAs the algorithm used in the study can be universally applied to any health record, it has incredible potential for identifying gaps in care and even improving quality and quality reporting.\u201d Barbara Di Eugenio (Photo: Roberta Dupuis Devlin) For example, Boyd says, hospital metrics typically focus on physician care, not nursing care. \u201cThis study offers foundational evidence that quality reporting may be more reflective of care and patients\u2019 experiences if it expands to equally include nursing care documentation,\u201d Boyd said. Lopez agrees and views the findings as proof that there is a need for detailed nursing documentation. \u201cWithout documentation from nurses, health records only show part of the whole,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI hope this study is viewed as a first step in identifying how the combination of nursing care and medical care work together to improve patient outcomes.\u201d The findings are published in the\u00a0International Journal of Medical Informatics. Barbara Di Eugenio, professor of computer science in the UIC College of Engineering, led the development of the algorithm. Additional co-authors on the study are Camillo Lugaresi, Tamara Macieira, Vanessa Sousa, Sabita Acharya, Abhinaya Balasubramanian, Khawllah Roussi and Michel Burton from UIC; Yves Lussier and Jianrong Li from the University of Arizona; and Gail Keenan from the University of Florida. This study relied on data from the MedLEE study, which was funded in part by the National Library of Medicine (R01LM008635).

The funding to MATEC, which is part of the department of family medicine at UIC\u2019s College of Medicine, is provided by two awards from the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Ricardo Rivero (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) \u201cTogether, these awards will help us advance our mission of increasing the number of health care professionals prepared to provide high-quality HIV and AIDS care to patients through the Midwest,\u201d said MATEC executive director Dr. Ricardo Rivero, who is the principal investigator of both awards. One award, in the amount of $2.4 million, will enable MATEC to improve HIV/AIDS training for students in medical, nursing and pharmacy schools located in all 10 Midwest region states. Over the course of four years, MATEC will work with accredited programs to incorporate the National HIV Curriculum e-learning platform into their program requirements, either by integrating the curriculum with pre-existing courses or by assisting in the development of new course offerings. UIC is one of only two academic institutions in the nation to receive funding for this project. Another award, in the amount of $2 million, will support MATEC\u2019s work with primary care physicians in both rural and urban environments for five years. The funding will establish the Midwest Fellowship for Primary Care Champions, a program designed to build capacity among primary care physicians to lead health care transformation. The program will work with a cohort of five primary care doctors each year to develop, implement and evaluate quality improvement projects in community-based clinics located in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. \u201cIt can be difficult for general practitioners to understand the unique and complex issues of HIV and AIDS care and prevention through current traditional medical education, and to keep up with new information and best practices,\u201d said Rivero, clinical assistant professor of family medicine. \u201cIt is likewise unlikely that pharmacy, nursing and medical students will seek out careers and pursue research involving HIV and AIDS topics if they remain unexposed to the topic during their medical training. This, combined with the increasing number of retiring primary care clinicians, is creating an environment in which care and prevention of HIV and AIDS are in danger of losing momentum. \u201cWith these two projects, we hope to change this dynamic across a continuum of care providers from students and future providers to veteran practitioners who are in positions that can champion system and clinic-based change,\u201d Rivero said. Dr. Memoona Hasnain, interim head of family medicine, said the two funding awards not only complement each other, but they also dovetail with the mission of family medicine. Memoona Hasnain \u201cOver the years we have come to learn that primary care health problems cannot be solved by one profession \u2014 it takes collaboration and teamwork across professions to address key public health issues and provide high-quality patient- and family-centered care, particularly for conditions like HIV, for which early detection and proactive preventive treatments to stop the spread of the virus are paramount,\u201d said Hasnain, who is also professor of family medicine. \u201cI am delighted that the department of family medicine is the home to this program and can provide leadership in advancing the science of best practices when it comes to HIV care, prevention and training.\u201d Rivero and Hasnain hope that with the two new grant awards MATEC and the department will inspire more students to pursue primary care and champion projects that reduce health disparities, many of which are associated with HIV/AIDS. \u201cThe need for more effective, equitable, affordable, accessible and sustainable primary care in the United States is well documented,\u201d Hasnain said. \u201cThe proposed projects build on our department\u2019s historical strong foundation of excellence in service, scholarship and expertise in health professions education.\u201d They also hope that in the long term these projects will improve HIV/AIDS outcomes through the Midwest region, which vary across its 10 states. \u201cAt this stage in the \u2018epidemic,\u2019 we know how to manage and prevent HIV, but the biggest challenges are the perpetuating stigma of the condition and the social challenges, like poverty, housing and transportation, experienced by many of those affected by HIV,\u201d Rivero said. \u201cIt is vital that frontline health care professionals are well trained and empowered to not only deliver high-quality primary care, but to mitigate the damage of these social challenges and this stigmatization among communities and other providers. \u201cFrom state to state and community to community, HIV prevalence varies,\u201d Rivero said. \u201cBut these programs give us the flexibility to work with schools and clinics in a way that addresses their local concerns and needs.\u201d MATEC, which was established at UIC in 1988, is celebrating its 30th\u00a0anniversary this year.

New research by computer scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago have identified numerous browser functionalities rarely used or needed by websites, but which pose substantial security and privacy risks to web surfers. Blocking website access to unnecessary browser functionality would help reduce these risks. Peter Snyder, a graduate student of computer science at UIC, and his colleagues looked at the costs and benefits associated with websites having access to 74 different types of functionality (collectively called web application programming interface, or API). They measured how frequently each of these features was used on websites, and how likely each was to pose a risk to security or privacy. Features with a low benefit to users, but a high security risk, were flagged as those that could be blocked to improve security, Snyder explained. \u201cFor example, browsers allow websites to perform low-level graphics calculations,\u201d said Snyder. \u201cWe found that this functionality is rarely used on honest websites, but that malicious sites can use it to harm users\u2019 privacy and security.\u201d Allowing all websites to access this feature is \u201ca bad cost-benefit trade-off,\u201d Snyder explained. Other examples of high-risk, low-benefit functionality the researchers uncovered included code that lets browsers detect light levels in a room, perform fine-grained timing operations and perform advanced audio synthesis operations. Snyder and his colleagues will present their findings at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Dallas on October 31. In their analysis, the researchers used Firefox as their test browser, since it is the most popular, fully open-source browser. Findings from the Firefox browser should generalize to other browsers, Snyder explained, because it has access to an almost identical suite of capabilities as other common browsers like Chrome and Internet Explorer. \u201cUltimately we saw that about 25 percent of web API posed high risks to security and privacy and could be blocked without breaking websites,\u201d Snyder said. He explained that by blocking risky functionality, the amount of code a website accesses is also reduced. \u201cThe less code you have available through the web API, the safer websites you\u2019ll have.\u201d Based on their findings, Snyder\u2019s team developed a browser extension that allows users to selectively block browser functionality to improve safety when it comes to surfing the web. Brave, a company focused on providing safer web browsing and founded by the inventor of JavaScript and the co-founder of Mozilla, plans on incorporating parts of the research into its open-source web browser, Brave Browser.

Image credit: Tanya Berger-Wolf , Chayant Tanipathananandh, Daniel Ruberstein, Sive Sundaresan. Click on image to download. Communities are defined\u00a0by flux: friendships that form and break, loyalties\u00a0that shift, and visitors passing through. But\u00a0these dynamic interactions\u00a0aren\u2019t represented\u00a0in static maps of social networks. Snapshot diagrams \u2013 with\u00a0lines drawn between individuals to show the ties that connect them based on data collected over time \u2013 can\u2019t tell the whole story. Zoologists are similarly hampered when trying to\u00a0analyze the community organization of social animals. The bonding behaviors\u00a0of related species may seem\u00a0similar, even though the environments that shaped the\u00a0animals\u2019\u00a0group-behavior are quite different. Two such closely related species are the endangered Grevy\u2019s zebra of Africa\u2014the largest surviving\u00a0wild equid \u2014 and the onager, a wild ass of Asia. A new, dynamic social-network analysis tool has revealed\u00a0that\u00a0the two species\u00a0actually have radically different social behaviors and community structures. The study\u00a0was published online in PLOS ONE. University of Illinois at Chicago computational ecologist Tanya Berger-Wolf led the multi-disciplinary team that\u00a0created CommDy, a\u00a0dynamic network computational framework, to better understand group behavior and community. Both Grevy\u2019s zebra and the Asian wild asses form\u00a0what are\u00a0known as fission/fusion communities, said Berger-Wolf, who is\u00a0associate professor of\u00a0computer science at UIC. In fission/fusion communities, individuals meet and spend time\u00a0with others in\u00a0different groups at different times. The\u00a0two animals\u2019\u00a0communities look similar,\u00a0using\u00a0a traditionally static social-network analysis. But the zebras are few in number, limited in range, and\u00a0menaced by large\u00a0predators\u00a0such as\u00a0lions. They often lack\u00a0access to water.\u00a0Onagers, in contrast, are relatively abundant and widespread, with no major predators and reliable access to water.\u00a0One would expect the two species to have evolved very different social structures to cope with their different circumstances. To observe the daily interactions within each of the two animal communities, three study co-authors from the Mpala Research Centre\u00a0in\u00a0Kenya\u2013ecologists Daniel Rubenstein of Princeton University, Siva Sundaresan of the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance\u00a0in Wyoming, and Ilya Fischoff of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research\u00a0in\u00a0Washington, D.C. \u2014 drove repeatedly along\u00a0the same route through the\u00a0animals\u2019\u00a0territory and recorded\u00a0the\u00a0size, duration and membership of different groups. The software allowed the researchers\u00a0to contextualize the observed interactions. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the latent community structure \u2014 loyalties, changes in affiliation, visiting with other groups \u2014 and the social cost of change,\u201d Berger-Wolf\u00a0said. Some\u00a0interactions may have a negative impact for\u00a0an individual, she said, by\u00a0increasing stress or inviting harassment.\u00a0Other social contacts may be\u00a0positive, by increasing status or access to resources. \u201cThe dynamic communities that resulted from that computational analysis were actually strikingly different,\u201d Berger-Wolf\u00a0said. The Grevy\u2019s zebra lived in large, stable\u00a0groups, with loyalty rewarded and visiting with other groups discouraged. Onagers formed smaller, less cohesive groups, with individuals able to\u00a0change\u00a0circles\u00a0with little\u00a0social cost. Berger-Wolf said these newly\u00a0revealed\u00a0differences make\u00a0sense, given the different\u00a0adaptation\u00a0each\u00a0species\u00a0needed to survive. And for the first time, scientists were able to quantify the differences, using the computational tool. Facing a constant threat from a\u00a0predator, the Grevy\u2019s zebra finds strength in numbers,\u00a0forming large groups of loyal individuals. The large, stable herd\u00a0is also able to share\u00a0found resources, like water. The onager, in contrast, can form smaller, more transient groups, being\u00a0less dependent on the herd\u00a0for protection or finding scarce resources. \u201cDynamic community analysis can be an important tool for testing ideas about the selective ecological and evolutionary forces that generate behaviors, revealing their adaptive value and significance,\u201d Berger-Wolf said.

(Photo: Jenny Fontaine) Brian Ziebart, assistant professor of computer science, has received a $500,000 National Science Foundation CAREER award, the NSF\u2019s top award for young researchers, to develop better structured prediction methods that could make autonomous vehicles safer and improve other applications in health care, financial market stability and safety. Ziebart works in the field of adversarial machine learning and is using it to improve structured prediction tasks \u2014 tasks that require the joint prediction of many related variables, rather than independent predictions for separate variables. For example, an autonomous vehicle\u2019s lane-change decision may depend on its estimates for position and velocity of nearby vehicles, its assessment of road conditions and other potential obstacles, and so on. Such a vehicle, Ziebart said, is trying to generalize from limited previous experience for machine learning, similar to the way Amazon\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d seeks to quickly learn its users\u2019 intentions and preferences. \u201cOne way to do it is to make worst-case assumptions about what you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said \u2014 a task for which generative adversarial networks are becoming popular. \u201cWe use a lot of optimization methodology, including convex optimization,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we use game theory to construct these prediction paths to make it efficient for real-time applications.\u201d In the case of computer vision for a self-driving vehicle, the machine learning utilizes context. \u201cIf you have pixels, and you want to assign which ones are car-pixels, rather than looking at each one, you look at a wider area that defines what car-pixels should be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe car-pixels will be near road-pixels, and this idea of leveraging structure happens at multiple levels.\u201d Ziebart received his undergraduate degree in computer engineering with highest honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He earned a master\u2019s degree in machine learning and his doctorate in knowledge discovery and data mining from Carnegie Mellon University. He did postdoctoral research in Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction Institute and Robotics Institute before joining the UIC computer science faculty in 2012. \n\nContact\n\nBill Burton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-2269\nburton@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nFaculty \n \nBill Burton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-2269\nburton@uic.edu\n Categories \nFaculty  Topics computer science, National Science Foundation, NSF, NSF Career Bill Burton | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://news.uic.edu/files/2017/05/Ziebart.Brian02.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/burton", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-faculty", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer-science", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/national-science-foundation", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/nsf", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/nsf-career", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/life-hacks-from-a-legendary-computer-programmer": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMarch 17, 2015\t\t\t  \u00a0 \u00a0 Grace Hopper \u201chad this spirit that students could learn from,\u201d says Women in Science and Engineering director Veronica Arreola.

She was a mathematics professor before she joined the Navy on her third try during World War II. Hopper was denied the first two times for being underweight and holding a job too important to national security. Upon acceptance, Hopper was assigned to work on the Harvard Mark I: a 10,000-pound computer used in World War II. It was long before then that Hopper learned how to understand machines. \u00a0 As a young girl, Hopper took apart seven alarm clocks to learn how they worked and how to fix them.\u00a0\u201cIt illustrates the point that she wasn\u2019t afraid to break things apart,\u201d Pierce said. \u00a0 Hopper never forgot to credit the female team that worked with her.\u00a0\u201cGrace was incredible about the women she worked with,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cShe knew that you should hold onto really good people and make concessions for them.\u201d Hopper is associated with the creation of the COBOL language, one of the first high-level programming languages, Pierce said. \u201cBut she came up with the idea of a compiler,\u201d she said. \u201cA program that translates machine language into human language, which is what COBOL is based off.\u00a0You can thank Grace for being able to have an app on your iPhone, and the same app on your friend\u2019s Android.\u201d \u00a0 Hopper was a genius, but she was also persistent.\u00a0\u201cPeople are framed as geniuses just because they persist,\u201d said Veronica Arreola, director of the Women in Science and Engineering Program and the organizer of the event. \u201cFrom what I know of Grace, she had this spirit that students could learn from. \u201cEven rocket scientists have to persist.\u201d Pierce is raising funds for \u201cBorn with Curiosity\u201d on the crowdsourcing site IndieGoGo.

Photo: Internet of Elephants/Solstice Mobile \u00a0 Lions and tigers and \u2026 wildlife-friendly business models! That\u2019s what UIC College of Engineering graduate students Filippo Pellolio, Marco Cavallo and Andrea Rottigni worked on for more than 36 hours at the Chicago Hackathon for Wildlife challenge. The event, Nov. 14 and 15, brought together students, professionals and wildlife enthusiasts of diverse backgrounds to brainstorm how to support wildlife conservation using technology. Hackathon for Wildlife was\u00a0organized by the Internet of Elephants, an organization that supports collaborations between nonprofit organizations and technologists, and held at Solstice Mobile, a Chicago software company. The challenge was inspired by public backlash over the hunting of Cecil the Lion in July, when hashtags like #justiceforcecil, #savethelions and #bantrophyhunting began viral trends. \u201cThe focus of the hackathon was about using technology to involve people in wildlife conservation,\u201d said Cavallo, a member of Team Italy with Pellolio and Rottigni, all students in computer science. Sixty participants from around the world formed teams of two to five members. This year\u2019s challenge: create an innovative business model that could connect 20 million people with wildlife, using technologies such as GPS hardware, data, social media and games. Experts and peers judged teams in four categories: use of technology, impact on wildlife conservation, quality of design and business model. Four winning teams were announced for overall best, best use of technology, best impact to conservation and best prototype. \u00a0 Team Italy, which came in second for best prototype, worked 36 hours straight on their entry, \u201cWildlife Defense\u201d \u2014 no sleep, just coding. \u201cThe hard part was coming up with the idea and the harder part was coding after 3 a.m.,\u201d Pellolio said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not easy.\u201d The students used principles they learned in class to develop a video game compatible with Android phones and desktop computers. \u00a0  \u00a0 The game lets users experience a day in the life of elephants, monkeys, cheetahs and giraffes. \u201cYou see the game from the point of view of the animals and you have to preserve their life. Humans may attack you, build where you live, steal your food or try to kill you, and you can try to find another place to live or fight against humans and make them stop building new villages around you,\u201d Cavallo said. Each animal has different strengths, needs and survival mode features. \u201cYou feel the oppression of the humans that try to constrain your life and try to put an end to your environment or your species,\u201d he added. \u201cWe hope that by playing this game, people can feel how animals are threatened by humans,\u201d Pellolio said. \u201cThe idea is to give the usual look and feel of a video game, but to change their perspective. They\u2019ll think, \u2018Someone else is trying to ruin my animals, and this bad guy is a human.\u2019\u201d All the hackathon business models are open-source.

new funding program catalyzing UIC-led activities to advance the mission of the University of Illinois System\u2019s Discovery Partners Institute (DPI). This opportunity will leverage up to $10 million from UIC\u2019s royalties\u2019 revenue as \u201cseed funds\u201d to align new UIC research activities with the DPI mission and priorities, and contributing to its development. Additional information on DPI can be found online. Several cycles of seed funding opportunities are anticipated, the first of which will target broad areas of big data and cybersecurity; drug discovery and healthcare delivery innovations; and automated vehicles and mobility. Applications for projects in other areas meeting established review criteria are also welcome. This announcement focuses on the initial two cycles of funding. Cycle 1, due November 1 with a projected start date of December 15, 2018, is designed to rapidly fund projects with a smaller scope (budgets up to $100,000). Cycle 2, due December 3 with a projected start date of January 15, 2019, focuses on funding larger projects requiring additional time to frame (budgets up to $250,000). Budgets for each cycle must reflect the actual project funding needs. It is anticipated up to 10 awards per cycle\u00a0will be funded; however, the actual number of funded projects is contingent upon submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. The Chancellor\u2019s Office, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, will review applications and select those to be funded.

Photos: Tanya Berger-Wolf/IBEIS \u00a0 If you can crowdsource everything else, why not giraffes and zebras? To celebrate Kenya\u2019s wildlife heritage, the Kenyan Wildlife Service hosted a Wildlife Festival and invited anyone with a camera \u2014 students, citizens and wildlife enthusiasts of every stripe \u2014 to photograph as many zebras and giraffes as possible at the Nairobi National Park on the first two days of March. The results: more than 10,000 photos, \u201ctaken by 31 teams, 75 photographers, and a bus of 40 school kids from the worst slum in east Africa who saw wild animals for the first time in their life,\u201d says computational ecologist Tanya Berger-Wolf. \u201cTheir photos will contribute to our knowledge of the ecology and conservation of the zebras and giraffes who live there,\u201d said Berger-Wolf, associate professor of computer science who directs the overall design of IBEIS (Image-Based Ecological Information System), software that will be used to analyze the photographs. The project will provide the final count of the number of zebras and giraffes in the park, she said. IBEIS can take collections of images from field scientists, tourists and incidental photographers \u2014 or gathered from camera traps, robots or drones \u2014 and answer queries about population size, species interactions, movement patterns and other data. The software was developed by a collaboration of scientists from UIC, Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the nonprofit WildMe.org. It can detect various species of animals in photo images and identify individual animals \u201cof most striped, spotted, wrinkled or notched species \u2014 much like recognizing a person by a fingerprint,\u201d Berger-Wolf said. \u201cIBEIS stores information about who the animals are, where and when they are there, and provides tools that scientists and curious people can use to find out what those animals are doing and why they are doing it.\u201d Such information, she said, can \u201cprovide a great tool for basic science and for improving management and conservation of animals.\u201d IBEIS uses images to answer queries about population size, species interactions, movement patterns and other data. IBEIS was piloted at the Mpala Research Centre and Ol\u2019Pejeta Nature Conservancy in Kenya. The first full prototype was deployed last month at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. Princeton University ecologist Daniel Rubenstein directs the biological aspects of IBEIS design and deployment. Charles Stewart, computer vision scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, oversees the image analysis engine for individual animal identification, based on the foundation of his software HotSpotter. Jason Holmberg, a data management expert with WildMe.org, created the WildBook, which powers the IBEIS data management system.

CKD affects more than 26 million people in the United States. People with the condition experience gradual loss of kidney function. In severe cases or when left untreated, CKD causes kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a transplant for survival. The study, which is published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, included nearly 4,000 individuals \u2014 1,778 women and 2,161 men \u2014 who were enrolled in the ongoing, multicenter\u00a0Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. The UIC researchers analyzed the incidence of end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trends \u2014 a key marker of kidney health \u2014 and death, and compared them by sex. At a median follow-up of seven years, the rate of ESRD per 100 people was 3.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The corresponding rates of death were 2.6 and 3.6, respectively. Dr. Ana Ricardo (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) \u201cWe found that women had 17 percent lower risk of experiencing ESRD and the risk of death was 31 percent lower in women than in men,\u201d said Dr. Ana Ricardo, lead author of the study. These differences persisted after adjustments for observed sex-related disparities in lifestyle and medical management, and after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, baseline kidney function, medications, and cardiovascular and metabolic factors. Ricardo said the findings were particularly striking, as they observed men were more likely to be on kidney-protective medications. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that women are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, but there has been conflicting research on CKD outcomes by sex,\u201d said Ricardo, associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. \u201cThis is the first study to analyze data from a large, representative sample of prospectively enrolled patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease. \u201cThe results of this study suggest that biology and psychosocial factors may be the driver of the sex-related disparity observed in patients with CKD,\u201d Ricardo said. Ricardo hopes the study increases public and care provider awareness of the higher risk of kidney failure and death among men. Funding for the CRIC Study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from the\u00a0National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963 and U01DK060902).

Instead, tumors arise when a mutation happens in a particular cell type that is uniquely sensitive to it. Identifying such cancer cells of origin is essential to properly target cancer. Maxim Frolov and Majd Ariss (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) For example, mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB)\u00a0tumor suppressor gene, which normally blocks abnormal cell growth and division, gives rise to retinoblastoma, a type of eye tumor. Retinoblastoma arises in specialized retinal cells called cone cells, which collect light. Why this kind of cancer always starts in cone cells is unknown. But if scientists can get a clearer, more accurate view of the downstream effects of RB mutations in cone cells versus other cells in the retina, they may identify unique therapeutic targets that can prevent or treat retinoblastoma with laser-like precision. But studying the effects of gene mutations in specific cell types is easier said than done. It is nearly impossible to collect pure samples made up of just one cell type. Instead, scientists often have to use a bulk sample prepared from an entire tissue. \u201cThis only gives a sort of average picture of gene expression in individual cells since it pools thousands of cells, some of which may be unwanted no matter how much the sample is purified. The results of examining the effects of RB mutations using these kinds of samples don\u2019t accurately represent how an RB mutation affects gene expression in a particular cell type,\u201d said Maxim Frolov, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. A revolutionary new technology called single-cell RNA sequencing lets researchers study gene expression in individual cells, eliminating the problem of contaminated cell samples and averaging. Frolov\u2019s laboratory adapted a technology called Drop-seq, which allows researchers\u00a0to isolate and genetically sequence single cells. Drop-seq can sequence thousands of individual cells at the same time. The single-cell RNA sequencer built by Majd Ariss. (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) Frolov and his graduate student, Majd Ariss, assembled a Drop-seq instrument to isolate cells of the eye in developing fruit flies, which the lab uses as a model system. Then they were able to study gene expression changes caused by mutations in the RB gene in thousands of different cells in the eye compared with gene expression in cells with normal copies of the RB gene. Their results are published in Nature Communications. \u201cSince this is the first time single-cell RNA sequencing has been performed in cells of the fruit fly eye, we had to create a comprehensive map or cell atlas, accurately describing gene expression in each cell type in the normal eye. We then relied on this atlas to determine how an RB mutation affects gene expression of each cell type in the eye,\u201d Frolov explained. Their analysis of eye cells with an RB mutation revealed a distinctive but small population of cells where the mutation altered gene expression and changed cell metabolism. The metabolic change sensitized the cells to apoptosis\u00a0or self-induced cell death. The propensity of cells with mutations in the RB gene to undergo apoptosis is a well-known phenomenon and is eventually overcome through additional mutations during the development of cancer, which is characterized by out-of-control cell growth and division \u2014 the opposite of apoptosis. \u201cThe metabolic changes we observed in RB mutant cells make them vulnerable in ways that might be exploited with therapeutic approaches before additional mutations hit the same cell, making them resistant to cell death,\u201d Frolov said. \u201cSince these effects were limited to such a small group of cells, they were previously missed when whole RB mutant eye tissue was analyzed.\u201d The Drop-seq platform took Ariss more than three months to build. He painstakingly followed instructions contained in a 40-page manual to generate his first single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. \u201cSingle cell sequencing is a truly revolutionary technology that promises to shed new light on the origin of cancer and why certain cancers originate in certain cell types and not others.

Cells harboring latent HIV are \u201cinvisible\u201d to the natural defenses of the immune system. The findings, which suggest a cure for HIV may be possible, are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. During infection, the DNA of HIV makes its way into the host cell\u2019s nucleus and integrates itself into the host genome. The Tat gene circuit is a key piece of HIV DNA that controls the HIV gene transcription and activation. When activated, it initiates a takeover of the cell\u2019s machinery to churn out new copies of the HIV virus, which eventually burst from the cell and infect neighboring cells. HIV-specific immune effector cells kill cells infected with HIV, but only when the cells are being used to produce more of the virus, meaning that the Tat gene circuit is switched on. In cells that are latently infected, the Tat gene circuit is off, and the cell goes about its normal business all the while harboring quiescent HIV. \u201cBy targeting the Tat gene circuit with drugs or small molecules to activate it, we would be able to cause latently-infected cells to start producing more virus, and then they can be destroyed by the immune system,\u201d said Jie Liang, the Richard and Loan Hill Professor of Bioengineering in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering and a lead author of the paper. So far, there are no drugs successfully targeting this circuit. People infected with the HIV virus can live relatively normal lives with exceedingly low or even undetectable viral loads thanks to powerful antiretroviral therapies that work to suppress viral replication. But even in people where the virus is undetectable, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely absent. The HIV virus can hide in cells in an inactivated state, meaning it isn\u2019t actively replicating. This is a dire situation and makes life-long antiretroviral therapy the only option for HIV infected patients. \u201cIt is extremely difficult to flush latently-infected cells out of their latency,\u201d Liang said. Techniques developed to reactivate latent HIV-infected cells so that they become susceptible to the body\u2019s natural immune response or to drug therapies have had mixed results \u2014 mostly because the technique, known as \u201cshock and kill,\u201d relies on a class of drugs called HDAC inhibitors that come with severe adverse effects. \u201cWe need to better understand the mechanisms that regulate HIV latency so we can identify new opportunities for intervention and develop better drugs that can either lock viral particles in a latent state, or kill latent cells, or both,\u201d Liang said. The Tat gene circuit has a random probability of being active or inactive, and the switch from inactive to active can happen spontaneously. \u201cIn HIV-infected cells, reactivation of the Tat gene circuit is still a very rare event,\u201d Liang said. Liang and his colleagues developed advanced computational algorithms to study the Tat gene circuit under different conditions. \u201cUsing different models and algorithms, we were able to accurately map a \u2018probability landscape\u2019 of the cellular reactions that can impact Tat gene circuit reactivation, and our results suggest new ways of targeting latent cells that may lead to the eradication of the HIV virus from a host,\u201d Liang said. Liang and his colleagues identified ways to manipulate the Tat gene circuit so that the \u201cshock and kill\u201d technique would be more effective. They also looked at a \u201cblock and lock\u201d strategy, where latent viral particles are locked into latency by permanently blocking activation of the Tat gene circuit. \u201cOur results suggest that by controlling HIV latency through manipulation of the Tat gene circuit, effective therapeutic strategies can be identified that would one day provide a cure for HIV,\u201d Liang said.

Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity and seizures, affects more than 65 million people worldwide. About one-third have difficulty controlling their seizures even with medication. Seizures can interfere with work, relationships and the ability to live independently. Previous research has shown that living in neighborhoods with high rates of crime have significantly higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\u00a0Stress is also a factor that is commonly reported to trigger seizures in people with epilepsy. The UIC study included 63 adults with epilepsy living within the city limits of Chicago who were participating in a larger study testing the efficacy of a tablet-based educational tool that provides tailored information about epilepsy. That study, called PAUSE, involves patients at the University of Illinois Hospital\u2019s epilepsy clinic and in the Chicagoland community and is facilitated by the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago. The researchers determined the levels of crime in neighborhoods of the 63 participants by mapping their ZIP codes to specific neighborhoods and then cross-referencing those neighborhoods with local crime rates available through the City of Chicago Police data portal. Participants self-reported the number of seizures they had in the past month and in the past three months. \u201cWe found that people living with epilepsy who live in high-crime neighborhoods experienced significantly more seizures,\u201d said Jessica Levy, a research coordinator in the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation who presented the findings. \u201cOn average, people in high-crime neighborhoods had three seizures versus one for people living in low-crime neighborhoods when we looked back over the last 30 days. Over the course of 90 days, people in high-crime neighborhoods had seven seizures on average compared to three for those living in low-crime neighborhoods, so the link between crime and seizure activity is significant.\u201d The researchers found no overall association between neighborhood crime status and the duration of epilepsy or between crime status and poverty. Having more seizures can significantly lower quality of life. Seizures that result in falls can cause bruising or even broken bones. There can also be a stigma associated with having a seizure in public. \u201cUnderstanding the impact of violence and crime as potential triggers for seizures underscores the need for further research that might allow clinicians to make better-informed recommendations for self-management education and stress management skills,\u201d said Dr. Dilip Pandey, associate professor of neurology and rehabilitation at UIC and an investigator on the study. Katharine Ozenberger is a co-investigator on the study. The PAUSE study is conducted through the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation by Dr. Dilip Pandey and Dr. Jeffery Loeb. PAUSE is supported by the University of Illinois Prevention Research Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network under CDC cooperative agreement no.

Illinois at Chicago scholars Wonhwa Cho and John Nitiss\u00a0have been named fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. Cho, UIC distinguished professor and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Endowed Chair in the Natural Sciences, and Nitiss, professor of pharmacology in the UIC College of Pharmacy, are among\u00a0416 members in the 2018 cohort to have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. The researchers will be honored at the AAAS Fellows Forum during the 2019 AAAS Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. Cho, who is also professor and head of chemistry and distinguished professor of liberal arts and sciences, was selected for his distinguished contributions to the field of chemical biology, particularly for his contribution to lipid binding proteins and the quantitative lipid imaging technology. \u201cI am honored to have been selected for this prestigious recognition,\u201d Cho said. \u201cOur lab focuses on understanding biological functions of diverse lipids, including cholesterol, especially as regulators of cellular proteins.\u201d Cho\u2019s research centers on lipids, which form the cell membrane that acts as a barrier between the cell and the surrounding environment. His discoveries of how membrane lipids control and modulate protein networks have the potential to transform approaches to drug development, as well as basic cellular biology. In a seminal paper published last year in Nature Chemical Biology, Cho and colleagues described the surprising finding that, in addition to its many other biological roles, cholesterol is a signaling molecule that transmits messages across the cell membrane. He is currently investigating how cholesterol and other cellular lipids control cellular processes to develop new strategies to treat diverse lipid-related human diseases, including breast cancer. Cho was named Researcher of the Year at UIC in 2015 and UIC Distinguished Professor in 2018, the latter honor is given to those who have made a significant impact upon their field through scholarship, creativity and leadership.\u00a0His work has also been recently recognized with 2018 Avanti Award by the Biophysical Society. Nitiss, who is also assistant dean for research at the college, was selected to become a fellow for his contributions to the study of topoisomerase targeting anti-cancer drugs and the development of yeast systems for studying anti-cancer drugs and other small molecules. His laboratory, which is based at the college\u2019s Rockford campus, uses a combination of genetic and biochemical tools to understand the action of anti-cancer agents. Nitiss\u2019 hallmark approach has been to use yeast as a model system to precisely define the pathways responsible for cell killing and drug resistance, and to apply insights obtained with yeast to in vitro biochemical systems and to mammalian cells. \u201cYeast is an appealing model organism to study a variety of biological processes, but problems of accumulation of drugs in yeast has been a major impediment,\u201d Nitiss said. \u201cThe unique reagents we developed have helped overcome this shortcoming and have allowed us to study the action of anti-cancer drugs in yeast.\u201d \u201cIt is an honor to receive recognition from the American Association for the Advancement of Science,\u201d he said. \u201cOur successes are due to the contributions of the many students and collaborators who have worked with me. We expect yeast will continue to provide new insights into the action of drugs relevant for the treatment of many human diseases.\u201d The tradition of AAAS fellows began in 1874. Members can be considered for the rank of fellow if nominated by a\u00a0steering group, by any three fellows who are current AAAS members, or by the AAAS chief executive officer. AAAS fellow\u2019s lifetime honor comes with an expectation that recipients maintain the highest standards of professional ethics and scientific integrity. \n\nContact\n\nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n\n\n \nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n Categories \nFaculty, Health Sciences Colleges, Research  Topics AAAS, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Pharmacy, research Jacqueline Carey | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/dg15_02_14_031", "https://today.uic.edu/john-nitiss-formatted-1-21", "https://today.uic.edu/author/jmcarey", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-faculty", "https://today.uic.edu/category/hsc", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/aaas", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-liberal-arts-and-sciences", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-pharmacy", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/research", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://today.uic.edu/dpi-submit-your-proposals-and-join-experts-groups": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNovember 20, 2018\t\t\t Dear colleagues: As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to share some of the remarkable progress we have made toward the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) since the discussion forums at each of our universities earlier this fall. We have formed the academic working groups that are helping develop DPI\u2019s initial plans and priorities, and the 125 members from across the system who are sharing their talents have been added to our DPI website. We have begun DPI operations in our 20,000-square-foot facility at 200 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, where we are able to host research, education and outreach projects, events, courses, and meetings. We have officially applied for the $500 million in state capital funding that the legislature approved last spring to develop DPI and IIN, which includes the projects at our universities that we outlined at the discussion forums in August. And we have greatly improved our website, transitioning it from a concept site to one that reflects a living, active institute. We have announced an IIN hub at Northern Illinois University, the first outside of the U of I System\u2019s three universities. We also have had very positive conversations with every four-year public university in the state about becoming an IIN hub, and expect additional hub announcements. As we continue our work, we hope many more of you will become involved. We invite you to join experts groups organized around DPI\u2019s themes and cross-cutting areas, and to submit proposals for DPI research, education, and engagement activities. The experts groups will provide feedback to guide development of each theme and cross-cutting area. The proposals will produce the first wave of educational, research, and outreach activities at DPI and are eligible for up to $15,000 of seed funding per project. The proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning on Dec. 14.

(Photo: Vibhu Sreevatsa Rangavasan) Faculty can now find enhanced support and resources for their teaching and technology needs through one team: the Learning Technology Solutions (LTS) group. A subgroup of the Academic Computing and Communications Center, LTS provides three major services: Equipment lending to faculty for in-class use is available in the LTS Support Office in Lecture Center E, Room 112, for microphones, laptops and presentation remotes. In the LTS Academic Multimedia Lab in the Daley Library IDEA Commons, faculty can borrow laptops, camcorders, audio recorders and more for video production needs. In-person workshops, general help and online webinars are also available to faculty and TAs. In the past, support for learning tools and instructional design and course development was offered by different ACCC groups \u2014 the Instructional Technology Lab and the Learning Environments & Technology Services office. But LTS has merged those services and improved them. \u201cBefore, faculty wasn\u2019t sure where to go,\u201d said Elizabeth Romero, director of LTS. \u201cSo now, we\u2019re really trying to make it accessible.\u201d The result is a combination of support for instructional design, software, and classroom or computer lab technology \u2014 a central point of contact for easily accessible solutions. There are three LTS facilities, including the Support Office, the Academic Multimedia Lab and the Instructional Design Office, located in Room 181 Benjamin Goldberg Research Center. New multimedia options will let faculty \u201cspice [courses] up using other tools,\u201d Romero said. The multimedia studio lets faculty record themselves talking during lectures, but a Lightboard that will be available next semester will allow faculty to record themselves while writing on a tempered, mounted glass board and displaying other relevant materials.

By David Staudacher \u2014 davidst@uic.edu The longevity of electronic devices is tested in many ways as they endure the rigors of daily usage. Even when they are treated with the utmost care, they still have a major challenge to overcome \u2014 the removal of heat. To alleviate this problem, Junxia \u201cLucy\u201d Shi, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, and her team of researchers in the Advanced Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory at UIC are focusing on using a novel method for cooling hotspots in electronics and capturing the wasted heat to use to power the devices. The new technique additionally has the potential to expand the longevity of electronic components. The results of their research were recently published in the prestigious journals Scientific Reports and Physical Review Materials. Electronic devices are getting miniaturized and produce a lot of heat when they carry currents. If the heat is not extracted out of the device, it will reduce the operating lifetime. Present cooling techniques are only efficient when the heat is close to the surface. Within a chip there are places called \u201chotspots,\u201d which are areas of localized high temperatures. \u201cThese are to be avoided; otherwise, they create failures,\u201d Shi said. \u201cOur targeted applications are heat sensors, energy converters, etc. We want to be able to gauge that heat generated in devices if desired, or better yet, extract that heat and convert to electricity.\u201d \u201cWhat we are trying to do here is use the intrinsic property of material in tandem with the modern techniques of thermal solid state cooling to drive more heat out of the device,\u201d said\u00a0 Parijat Sengupta, a postdoctoral researcher who is working under Shi\u2019s direction. \u201cWe are looking at the internal arrangement of electrons, how they carry out the motion within the crystal, and how the motion gives rise to a certain kind of magnetic field, which is not applied from the outside. It is like having an internal magnetic field and it creates an additional avenue to drive more heat out of the device.\u201d The researchers theoretically quantified how much heat can be driven, and they discovered that a lot of heat is produced, and the energy can be harvested. \u201cYou drive current through a device \u2014 so you are applying voltage \u2014 and in turn you are receiving heat, which usually goes to waste. We are trying to use that heat in multiple ways,\u201d Shi said. \u201cThe heat can be utilized by driving a thermal power generator, where the heat produces electricity again,\u201d Sengupta said. \u201cAlso, we can use heat to drive \u2018spin currents,\u2019 which is the internal attribute of the electron.\u201d \u201cDriven by the motivation to do energy harvesting, we chose a material where extra impetus can be had from the material\u2019s internal arrangement of atoms and electrons and see what are the optimal experimental setups we can look for that maximize the heat flow,\u201d Sengupta added. The researchers are using thermal power generators from an application standpoint because of the heat that it can draw out and drive another generator. There are two effects, called the Seebeck effect and the Peltier effect, which are at play in the research. \u201cIf I drive heat through this material that will create a temperature gradient and that gives rise to voltage that you can use for something else. That\u2019s the primary goal in mind,\u201d Sengupta said. \u201cThe second is the spin current. We introduced the spin of electrons into our work. That is what makes this research interesting.\u201d Learn more about professor Shi and her research at Advanced Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory. \n\nContact\n\nUIC News contributor\n\nuictoday@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nResearch \n \nUIC News contributor\n\nuictoday@uic.edu\n Categories \nResearch  Topics computer, electrical and computer engineering, electricity, energy, heat sensors UIC News contributor | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/08/DSC_0010.jpg", "http://shi.uic.edu/", "https://today.uic.edu/author/uicnews-opa", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/electrical-and-computer-engineering", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/electricity", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/energy", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/heat-sensors", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://gsc.uic.edu/safe-zone": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari. \n    Skip to\n    \nthe content of this page,\n    \nthe main menu,\n        the secondary menu,\n        Google Translate,\n    the site search form\n    or go to the\n    the site home page.\n   Providing professional development to on-campus and off-campus partners. History and Background The Safe Zone program at UIC began in 2002. The program emerged during a national trend in higher education to provide educational experiences to faculty, staff, and students around sexual orientation and gender identities and issues while providing applicable skills to address homophobia, heterosexism, and trans*phobia on campus. The content and methods of delivery continue to evolve in response to current events and recent scholarship. Although the Gender and Sexuality Center\u2019s Safe Zone program foregrounds sexual orientation and gender identity, we also recognize these identities influence and are influenced by other social identities (e.g. race/ethnicity, class, and ability) as well as systems of power, privilege, empowerment, and liberation. Therefore, we take an intersectional approach in our discussions of identity and context. Safe Zone workshops are available upon request. The staff of the GSC will consult with you to develop an interactive workshop experience that provides specific expertise relevant for your unit, department, or organization to increase awareness of LGBTQ issues and concerns and implement holistic and inclusive polices and practices. Please contact Mois\u00e9s Villada at moises@uic.edu or 312-413-8619 for more information. ALL UIC students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to attend this University-sanctioned workshop. Release time is generally granted according to the Attendance at University Events policy. For more information, please contact University Human Resources. Overarching Goals of Safe Zone: Gender and Sexuality Center programming is intended to create Safe Zones across campus and in Chicago. The goals of Safe Zones are to:\n\u2022 increase knowledge of vocabulary, concepts, and terms connected to sexual orientation and gender identity;\n\u2022 increase knowledge of micro (e.g. individual), meso (e.g. familial, cultural), and macro (e.g. institutional, societal) issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity;\n\u2022 increase awareness of the negative impact of homophobia, trans*phobia, and heterosexism on all people;\n\u2022 increase confidence in making appropriate referrals as needed; and\n\u2022 increase comfort in acting as an ally on behalf of LGBTQ people. Intended Audiences\nThe intended audiences for Safe Zone are faculty, staff, and students across the UIC campus. Different Types of Safe Zones\nTo address the goals of creating an inclusive campus for LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff, Safe Zone workshops are conducted in a variety of settings. Settings for Safe Zone workshops include Classrooms, Brown Bags, Units & Departments, Student Organizations, Conferences, & External Organizations. As part of our consultative process, the workshops range in length depending on the goals and needs of the requesting unit. Examples of our Safe Zone workshops include Safe Zone 101 & Trans Safe Zone:\n\u2022 Safe Zone 101 provides an introduction and overview of vocabulary, concepts, current events, policies, identity development models and issues related to coming out for LGBTQ people and communities.\n\u2022 Trans* Safe Zone addresses terminology, concepts, and policies specific to trans* and gender non-conforming people including details related to social, legal, and physical transitioning. Multi-Layered Collaborative Process\nThe Safe Zone 2.0 program has multiple components with intentions to build collaborative relationships across campus and provide on-going support for greater inclusivity at UIC.

Colleges, graduate programs, administrative offices, and research centers appoint graduate students as teaching (TA), research (RA), or graduate assistants (GA). Students apply for and obtain most assistantships through their graduate programs. The Human Resources Job Board has listings for assistantships that are open to the general graduate student population (see listings towards bottom of the above link). Comprehensive information about assistantships is found at the UIC 101 Graduate Assistants page.\u00a0 That page includes a Graduate Assistantship HR Resource Guide. Descriptions:\u00a0 At UIC,\u00a0teaching assistantships, research assistantships and graduate assistantships\u00a0are available.\u00a0For information on available assistantships,\u00a0contact the Director of Graduate Studies in the academic program.\u00a0 Work Schedule: The weekly clock hours of service required of assistants are twenty for a half-time (50% FTE) appointment and the proportional fraction of time for other appointments. Stipend: Minimum stipend amounts are established through collective bargaining. Departments may offer higher than the minimum. See\u00a0Salary for Graduate Assistantships (includes eligibility criteria for the appointment to be qualified for a waiver of tuition\u00a0certain fees) for the current year. Specifications for upcoming years may be viewed in the contract - see the link in the Teaching (TA) and Graduate (GA) Assistantship Labor Agreement section below. Even though Research Assistantship (RA) appointments are not under the contract, the minimum stipend applies to those positions as well. Application for Graduate Appointment:\u00a0 Verify with the unit or academic program from which you are seeking an appointment if they require the Application for Graduate Appointment form. Many units and academic programs use their own form. Waivers: Tuition and the some fees are waived for assistants if the appointment is between 25 and 67 percent for at least three-quarters of the term (91 calendar days in fall or spring semester, 41 calendar days during the summer session). To determine if an appointment meets the calendar-day requirement, see appointment duration ranges.\u00a0 The waiver does not cover any tuition differential that may be assessed, except for students registered in the following programs: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth & Environmental Sciences, Physics, and Psychology. See the tuition schedule\u00a0for information on specific\u00a0tuition rates. Graduate students who hold academic appointments as assistants for the spring semester and for whom tuition and service fees were waived in the spring are entitled to a waiver for the summer term immediately following if they do not hold a summer assistantship, provided they are registered for at least three hours during that summer term. Graduate students holding a summer assistantship must satisfy eligibiliy requirements for a waiver, as described in the previous paragraph, as well as the registration requirements specied below. Assistantship waivers cover the following charges: Assistantship waivers do not cover the following charges: For a complete tuition and fee schedule, please refer to the Office of Registration and Records. Taxation of Graduate Assistant & Pre-Professional Graduate Assistant Tuition Waivers:\u00a0 Please see Frequently Asked Questions. Registration Requirements: At least eight (8) hours each semester. Registration in summer is not required to hold an assistantship.\u00a0 Some programs may require registration for more than eight hours per term and/or summer registration. Although the Graduate College does not require summer registration to hold a summer assistantship, a minimum of three hours registration is required to receive a summer tuition and (selected) fee waiver. Students receiving an assistantship must maintain a minimum registration through the end of the term in order to retain the waiver. A minimum of eight (8) hours in fall and spring is required for the waiver. (Note: This is different from the 12 hours required of Graduate College fellowship and allocated waivers.) Summer registration is optional for students with summer appointments, but a minimum three (3) hours in summer is required to receive the waiver. International students may have additional registration requirements. Generally: Summer registration is not required (see above). International students\u00a0should confer with the Office of International Services\u00a0for additional information. Assistantship Offer Letter Templates:\u00a0 Hiring units must follow the assistantship offer letter template on the offer letters sent to students (Teaching Assistant (TA); Research Assistant (RA); Graduate Assistant (GA)). There are seperate templates TAs and GAs, and the templates are by academic year (must be followed, as the tuition differential listings change by academic year). RAs are not part of the GEO union, so information about the union should not be included in the RA offer letter. Dental and Vision Insurance:\u00a0 Dental and vision benefits are provided by the University for all assistantship recipients with at least a 25% appointment. See the\u00a0Grad Assistant Dental and Vision Benefits page on the UIC HR website for full details about eligibility and enrollment in these plans. In addition, Assistants who utilize CampusCare have dental and vision benefits through CampusCare (see the Benefits tab on the top of the CampusCare site). Teaching (TA) and Graduate (GA) Assistantship Labor Agreement:\u00a0 Effective August 16, 2006, Teaching and Graduate Assistants at UIC have entered into an agreement by and between the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois and the Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO). Administration of the agreement is handled by Office of Human Resources. Please refer to the current\u00a0agreement (August 16, 2015 - August 15. 2018) to learn more about the rights and responsibilities contained therein. Please\u00a0refer to\u00a0the\u00a0Human Resources web site for contact information. [The current agreement is in force until a new agreement is signed.] Assistantships and Student Loans:\u00a0\u00a0An assistantship plus any loan or federal work-study eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for the academic year. This is a federal rule.

If a student fails to meet the performance or other criteria stated by the program as determined by the Graduate College the program may notify the Graduate College to initiate dismissal. Limited admission status students must meet the conditions imposed by this status and progress to full degree status within two semesters or any shorter amount of time set forth in the letter of acceptance. Failure to do so will result in automatic dismissal from the University. The Graduate Degree GPA is the average of grades earned by graduate students in their current degree program, whether or not the courses are part of degree requirements. Only graduate-level courses in which an A, B, C, D, or F is earned are included in the Graduate Degree GPA computation. A graduate-level course is any 400- or 500-level course, plus any 300-level course taken under the quarter system. General transfer credit taken at other institutions is not computed in the Graduate Degree GPA. However, grades earned through the CIC Traveling Scholars Program are included. Grades earned as a non-degree student, or while a student in other UIC colleges or a different graduate program, will be computed if the courses are applied to the current graduate program through an approved transfer of credit petition. Academic probation is the Graduate College\u2019s mechanism for warning students that their Degree GPA has fallen below the minimum standard of 3.00 (A=4.00). Students have two terms of enrollment (including summer, if registered) after the term in which their Degree GPA falls below 3.00 to remove themselves from probation. Departments may enforce stricter limits on probation, provided the student is informed in writing prior to being placed on probation. Students who leave the University while on probation, whether through formal withdrawal or through failing to meet the registration requirement, will still be on probation if they are later readmitted to the same program. Students that are admitted to a new program, begin as a new student (i.e., the Degree GPA starts over). Students currently on probation or who left the University on probation will not be admitted to the same program as non-degree students. Readmission as a degree-seeking student is not guaranteed. Students who fail to raise their average to 3.00 or to otherwise fulfill the terms of their probation within the deadline will be dismissed from the University. The Graduate College issues probation and dismissal notices to students and their program directors. However, failure to receive notice does not change the student\u2019s probation or dismissal status, since students are expected to monitor their own progress in light of Graduate College policies. Students must be on good academic standing in order to graduate, even if all other requirements have been met. Students on probation (Degree Grade Point Average less than 3.0) will not be allowed to graduate unless good academic standing is achieved by raising the Degree GPA to 3.0 or greater.  \u00a9 ", "out_links": ["https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/rss.xml", "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/degree-programs/grad-prof-degree-programs/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/degree-programs/program-updates/", "http://uic.edu", "https://my.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu", "https://grad.uic.edu/rss.xml", "https://grad.uic.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?target=http%3A%2F%2Fgrad.uic.edu%2F%3Fq%3Dshib_login%2Fnode%2F365"]}, "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/course-descriptions": {"text": "The graduate catalog is published every two years.

CR\u2014 Credit; NC\u2014 No Credit. Used only in courses taken under the credit/no credit grading option. No grade points are earned and the grade is not computed in the grade point average. If the required work for the course has not been completed by the end of the term, at the instructor\u2019s discretion an IN may be given. Graduate students may take courses on a credit/no credit basis provided that: (1) The courses are not within their immediate area of specialization, (2) such courses account for no more than one sixth of the total number of course hours taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago and counted toward a degree, and (3) they declare their intention to take a course on this basis at the time of registration and have the approval of their advisor and director of graduate studies. Some programs do not allow any Credit/No Credit courses to be used toward degree requirements. Credit/No Credit grades cannot be changed to grades A-F at a later date. (Note:\u00a0 Previous to Fall 2004\u00a0the grade of CR was designated as P-Pass, the grade of NC was designated as F-Fail, and the\u00a0current grade of F was desgnated as E.) S\u2014Satisfactory; U\u2014Unsatisfactory. Used as grades in thesis research courses, in zero-credit courses, and in specifically approved courses. No grade points are earned and the grade is not computed in the cumulative grade point average or the graduate degree grade point average. In the case of thesis research courses, instructors should assign an S or U grade to the course each term. They may assign a DFR grade each term until after the thesis defense is successfully completed, the thesis committee accepts the format and content of the thesis, and the Graduate College approves the format of the thesis, but this is not recommended. In the latter case, the Graduate College will notify the registrar to change the DFR grades to S. An Unsatisfactory grade can be assigned at any time when the student is not making satisfactory progress in thesis research. If this should occur, the status of the student will be reviewed by the advisor, the director of graduate studies, and the Graduate College, and the student may be dismissed from the Graduate College. W\u2014Withdrawn. Officially withdrawn from the course without academic penalty; no credit is earned for the course. Assigned if course is dropped after the tenth day of the semester (fifth day in summer) and before the last day of instruction for the term.

It is the responsibility of the program to monitor any departmentally imposed admission conditions as well as progress toward degree requirements. Students who do not meet program standards must be notified by the program, with a copy to the Graduate College, of their deficiencies, their deadline for removing deficiencies, and the consequences of not removing the deficiencies. The DGS should notify the Graduate College when to initiate drop action for students who have not met the departmental requirements or made satisfactory progress within the prescribed amount of time. See more detail below. Students who are admitted on limited standing are notified of the conditions of admission in writing (a copy of the letter is simultaneously sent to the Graduate College) at the time of admission. Students are placed on limited standing for up to two semesters. A student who violates the conditions stated in the limited standing letter should be dismissed at the end of the term of the violation. The program informs the Graduate College, including the reason and justification, and the Graduate College initiates the dismissal procedure after an investigation is finalized. The program may not initiate dismissal for limited status conditions after a later term, if the student was not dismissed immediately after the term in which the violation occurred. Rarely, the Graduate College sets the exact limited status conditions. In these situations, the Graduate College may initiate dismissal if a violation of the conditions occurs. A program may initiate academic dismissal for a student for a variety of reasons, including failure to make satisfactory progress, violation of time-to-degree requirements, program probation policy, etc. To initiate academic dismissal, the DGS must provide the Graduate College written rationale for the dismissal, as well as a copy of the program's handbook or other written guidelines where this information was provided to the student. The rules or guidelines cited must apply to all students in the program, and must be enforced equally for all students. The program does not dismiss the student but makes the recommendation to the Graduate College. The Graduate College initiates the dismissal procedure after an investigation is finalized. When the Degree GPA falls below 3.00 (A=4.00), students are sent a warning letter (with copies to the program) that notifies them that they have two additional terms of registration (including summer, if registered) after the warning term to raise the average to 3.00. The progress of students on probation status is reviewed each term. Students who do not remove themselves from probation status in subsequent semesters are notified of their continued grade point deficiencies until they reach the two-term deadline. Students who raise their GPA to 3.00 or above within the deadline will be removed from probation. Students who fail to raise their average to 3.00 or above within the deadline will be dismissed from the University. The Graduate College makes every effort to notify students of their dismissal in a timely fashion. Failure to receive notification, however, does not alter the student's dismissal status. Students are expected to monitor their progress in light of departmental and Graduate College policies. If a student registers for only courses that are not graded A-F (i.e. courses not included in the GPA) such as research (S/U), etc., the term still counts against the time allowed to get off probation, including summer term. The situation of taking only research in summer for a student on probation would be taken in consideration for any petition for extension of probation. If the DGS determines that an extension of probation is warranted for a student who received a drop letter, the student must complete a Graduate Student Petition and obtain signatures from the advisor and DGS. The DGS must provide justification for the extension on the petition, as well as any conditions (eg. must take only courses from that department, etc.). The petition must arrive in the Graduate College no later than the start of the next term, including summer (whether or not the student will register in that term). The student must register for enough graded 400- and 500-level credit to make up the deficiency in one term. In very rare instances, a DGS may request that the student take less hours than what is required to make up the deficiency. If this request is granted by the Graduate College the student must show significant progress in making up the deficiency before a second extension would be granted. All extensions are for one term only. Future extensions are not guaranteed and would only be considered with the DGS approval and if the student shows significant progress in making up the deficiency. In BANNER, the Degree Grade Point Average is found on the SHADEGR form. Academic Standing (probation level) is on SGASTDN form. Academic Standing codes are: 01=warning; 02=first term probation; 03= pending drop; 04=1st extension; 05=pending drop; 06=2nd extension; 07 and 09=pending drop. Pending drop codes are temporary and are changed to an extension code listed above or to Drop. Once the final Drop is posted on SGASTDN the student will no longer be able to register. It is the student's responsibility to monitor his/her own progress in light of Graduate College policies. While the Graduate College does issue probation and dismissal notices and guidelines to both students and their DGS, failure to receive such notice does not change the student's probation or dismissal status.

We are a new multidisciplinary doctoral training program at the University of Illinois at Chicago educating specialists in the information technology aspects of transportation science. Our Computational Transportation Science (CTS) fellows are developing technologies in which sensors, travelers computers (e.g., PDAs), in-vehicle computers, and computers in the static infrastructure are integrated into a collaborative environment. They are also investigating how these technologies are adopted as well as the implications of their adoption. The envisioned environment will enable solutions to transportation problems ranging from dynamic ride-sharing, real-time multi-modal routing and navigation, to autonomous/assisted driving, to inferring travel patterns via data mining. \n\r\n  CTS is funded by the National Science Foundation via an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant. The grant provides two-year IGERT fellowships to 25-30 Ph.D. students over a five-year period, as well as supporting a new curriculum and internship training for students.\r\n     The main components of the CTS program are course-work, research projects, and development of the Intelligent Traveler Assistant (ITA) experimental prototype that demonstrates the research results. Some of the research projects and the prototype will be done in collaboration with our partners through internships. \n\r\n            Our IGERT fellows are selected from Ph.D. students in the following five core departments:  IGERT: PhD program in Computational Transportation Science ", "out_links": ["http://www.uic.edu", "http://cts.cs.uic.edu/newspage.php?m=21", "http://cts.cs.uic.edu/newspage.php?m=21", "http://cts.cs.uic.edu/apply.php?m=42", "http://www.cs.uic.edu", "http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/upp/", "http://www.uic.edu/depts/cme/cme.html", "http://www.mie.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu/cba/cba-depts/ids/"]}, "http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page": {"text": "    To schedule an interview, click the \"book now\" button below.  *Appointments must be made at least 12 hours in advance. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  English Oral Proficiency testing for new international TAs is now available for the months of May and July - September 2018.

Then click on the \"Graduation\" tab and you will see the link \"View Active Graduation Applications.\" If you have lost access to the my.uic.edu because you have not been a registered student for over two semesters, go to\u00a0https://apps.uillinois.edu/StudentFacSelfService.html\u00a0and log into Student Self-Service.\u00a0 You will be able to complete the Intent to Graduate in Self-Service.\u00a0 (Note:\u00a0 If you have forgotten your password, there\u00a0is a link\u00a0to change\u00a0with information on the login page.) Graduate Concentrations that have been officially approved and that have been certified by the student's Director of Graduate Studies, or\u00a0concentration office (interdepartmental only),\u00a0as having been completed will appear on the diploma when the completed degree is posted.\u00a0 If you have completed a concentration and the information is not present when processing your Intent to Graduate you must add the information in the text box before submitting the form (see above).\u00a0 Click here for a list of approved concentrations by program. The Diploma is a recognition of completion of your degree, although the offical document attesting to completion of a degree is the transcript.\u00a0 Diplomas are mailed to graduates approximately one month after the term of graduation.\u00a0 Diplomas are mailed after Fall, Spring and Summer terms and are not distributed at the Fall and Spring term commencement ceremonies.\u00a0 Diplomas are\u00a0sent to the Diploma Mailing address in the student database.\u00a0 Students may change the mailing address as needed using the procedures detailed in the Intent to Graduate.\u00a0 Alternatively, students may enter a Diploma Mailing Address in Student Self-Service up until one week after final exams end.\u00a0 If the Diploma Mailing Address needs to be added or changed after that time, the student must contact the Office of Registration and Records (Records) in the Office of Admissions and Records.\u00a0 Also, if the diploma is not received after three months, or there are questions about the diploma, the Office of Registration and Records (Records) should be consulted.\u00a0 For contact information and additional\u00a0information about diplomas\u00a0consult the\u00a0diploma section of the Registration and Records website.\u00a0\u00a0 See also the Transcript section below and Commencement Ceremonies. Deadlines for filing the Intent to Graduate, submission of the Thesis/Dissertation\u00a0to the Graduate College, and submission of Master Project Certificate of Approval forms are listed under the Academic Calendar. The University of Illinois at Chicago establishes an official date of conferral of degrees for every term (Fall, Spring and Summer).\u00a0 Although degree requirements, including, for example, defense of thesis, may have been completed earlier in the term, the official date of graduation is what is printed on the student transcript. \u00a0 The date all requirements have been completed may be needed\u00a0to qualify for a job, other appointment, or\u00a0for Practical Training (international students).\u00a0 However, the official graduation date is the date of degree conferral. Also, the official conferral date of a degree may or may not correspond with the date of your commencement ceremony. Official graduation dates by term may be viewed here.

The University of Illinois at Chicago helps students succeed in a challenging, exciting and diverse global community of scholars. UIC offers the tools and support you\u00a0need for\u00a0the best college experience possible. We provide\u00a0access to extensive academic and student support services\u00a0that\u00a0help in your\u00a0courses and in\u00a0connecting with classmates. Peer mentoring, tutoring and specialized workshops\u00a0make your academic experience better. All students are encouraged to take advantage of these resources and academic guidance. Most students need help paying for college. UIC\u2019s Office of Student Financial Aid can advise you on the paperwork required and deadlines that must be met to apply for loans and grants. They can also tell\u00a0you about public and private scholarships. The Office of Student Employment can help you find a part-time job, either working for UIC on campus or for an off-campus employer. Current undergraduates and professional students can seek help finding scholarships and fellowships through the Office of Scholarships and the Office of External Fellowships.\u00a0 Graduate students can find similar help directly from the Graduate College. College is more than academics. The opportunity to grow socially and culturally is just as important. UIC offers resources dedicated to student involvement, support, networking and social interaction. Campus Programs is your source for live events, cultural programs, diverse student organizations and student-produced entertainment. Students can enhance their learning and development through\u00a0The UIC Experience, co-curricular programs that focus on three key areas: urban exploration, inquiring minds and community. The Office of Diversity oversees seven\u00a0Centers for Cultural Understanding\u00a0and Social Change that provide support to specific populations on campus and opportunities for intercultural engagement among students, faculty, staff and Chicago communities. At UIC, our students\u2019 health and well-being are just as important as their classroom success. \u00a0That\u2019s why all students are automatically enrolled in the convenient\u00a0CampusCare health insurance program.\u00a0CampusCare provides students with basic health services on campus. The Family Medicine Center also offers care to students and provides referrals to specialty services. Students can work out, take a class, train with an instructor or get a massage at UIC\u2019s\u00a0state-of-the-art fitness centers.\u00a0The Wellness Center promotes healthy attitudes and behaviors through information, educational programs and skill-building activities.\u00a0UIC\u2019s\u00a0Counseling Center\u00a0helps students deal with stress, cope with the transition to college, gain strength from gender and cultural identity, and manage mental illness. An exciting\u00a0future lies beyond the walls of UIC, and we want to assist you in your transition from student to professional. The Office of Career Services provides educational workshops to help you\u00a0write r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters, search for jobs, learn\u00a0interview and networking tips, use social media in your job search and many more topics. The office also provides guidance\u00a0if you are undecided in your major or are considering graduate school. We can also help you navigate job sites on the Internet, find\u00a0career fairs and secure an internship. Your new career awaits. We can help make it happen.

The self-assessment survey requires students to submit some basic information, self-evaluation, publications, presentations and plans for the upcoming year (research, publication and deadlines for milestones in the completion of the degree). \u00a0Once the student completes and submits the survey, the advisor receives notification that allows them to verify and provide feedback on student\u2019s progress. Registration General registration policies are outlined by the Graduate College (http://grad.uic.edu/registration-policies). Doctoral students upon passing the preliminary exam are required to register for at least zero credit hours each semester (excluding summer) until the final defense is completed and the dissertation is submitted in compliance with department and Graduate College rules. \u00a0If the PhD candidate decides to defend during the Summer, registration is required for Summer term.\u00a0 PhD candidates are not required to register after they successfully defend their dissertation unless registration is required to maintain a specific status (i.e., assistantship, visa, or continued use of university facilities). If a PhD candidate successfully defends the dissertation and submits the final dissertation to the Graduate College after the semester deadline but prior to the fifth day of instruction of the following semester, the degree is conferred in the subsequent semester. Registration for that semester is not required. See http://grad.uic.edu/zero-hour-registration for further details. Time Restrictions Students admitted to the Graduate College with a master\u2019s degree or who continue in the Graduate College after completing the master\u2019s degree at UIC must complete the degree requirements within seven consecutive calendar years after initial registration as a doctoral student. Students admitted to the Graduate College without a master\u2019s degree who proceed directly to the doctorate must complete degree requirements within nine consecutive calendar years of initial registration as a doctoral student. Students who do not graduate by these deadlines will be dismissed from the Graduate College for failure to progress. Time spent on a leave of absence approved by the program and the Graduate College is not counted toward the degree time limit. Transfer Credit After admission to the PhD program, students may petition to transfer coursework not used for previous degree. \u00a0A maximum of 9 semester hours earned outside the department are eligible for transfer; credits from non US institutions are generally not allowed. A transcript showing the courses with grades and course syllabi must be submitted with the Transfer Credit petition. Upon request, the student must also provide an official letter from the university stating the course(s) were not used to satisfy any prior degree requirements. Students changing from \u201cnon-degree\u201d to \u201cdegree\u201d status at UIC may petition up to 12 semester hours of credit earned. Only graduate level courses in which a grade of A or B was earned will be eligible for transfer. Transfer credit from outside UIC is not allowed once a student starts their graduate studies in the Computer Science program at UIC. Changing to the MS Program: Not allowed The UIC College of Engineering Strategic Plan, adopted in January 2005 and revised from time to time, states that students in a PhD program who have received any financial support from UIC (such as TA, RA, or Tuition and Fee Waiver) cannot transfer into any MS program in the College of Engineering (which includes computer science) \u201cunless the student explicitly petitions to transfer to the MS program and that petition is approved\u201d. PhD candidates admitted directly from the BS degree, do NOT earn a MS degree prior to their PhD.\u00a0 They graduate only with a PhD degree. Prior Publication of Research Findings Students engaged in research may choose to publish certain findings that are later incorporated into the final dissertation. \u00a0In such cases, appropriate acknowledgment of the earlier publication should be included in the final dissertation.\u00a0 The Graduate College encourages such publication, but the dissertation may not be published in its entirety before all degree requirements, including the defense of the dissertation, have been completed. The current Qualifying Exam has been in effect since Fall 2012. PhD Qualifying Exam Information\u00a0provides details on the requirements of it\u2019s successful completion of each of the three parts. The purpose of the Preliminary Examination is to determine the candidate\u2019s readiness to undertake dissertation research, and passing it constitutes formal Admission to Candidacy. The examination serves as the next major step toward the PhD degree except for the completion and defense of the dissertation. The examination provides the student with timely feedback of the faculty\u2019s views of his/her potential for completing the PhD Program. The preliminary examination is generally administered once the student has completed most, though not necessarily all, of the coursework, but has not made a major investment of time and effort towards the dissertation research project. A minimum of one year has to elapse before the defense of the dissertation after passing the preliminary examination. Only students in good academic standing are permitted to take the examination. Preliminary Examination Committee The committee for the preliminary examination is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College upon the recommendation of the department or program. \u00a0The advisor is the chair of the Committee and must be a full member of the UIC Graduate Faculty.\u00a0 All CS assistant, associate, full professors and adjunct faculty are eligible to serve as an advisor. \u00a0The composition of the five-member committee should be as follows: Graduate programs strive for diversity in the composition of the preliminary examination committee. \u00a0The appointment of one or two members from outside the degree-granting program or university is encouraged. \u00a0If the outside member is not a UIC graduate faculty member, his/her curriculum vitae must accompany the Committee Recommendation Form to demonstrate equivalent academic standards. Preliminary Examination Pass Requirements A Committee Recommendation form (http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms), listing the committee members and their affiliations, must be submitted at least three weeks prior to the exam date to the CS Student Affairs for department approval. \u00a0Upon department approval, the form will be forwarded to the Graduate College for final approval.\u00a0 If human subjects are involved, Institutional Review Board approval is required. \u00a0If animals are involved, Animal Care Panel approval is required. \u00a0Graduate College will forward an examination report to the department, which has to be signed by each member of the committee after assigning a grade of \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d. \u00a0The timing, content, and nature (written, oral, or both) of the preliminary examination is left at the discretion of the preliminary examination committee.\u00a0\u00a0 A candidate cannot be passed with more than one \u201cfail\u201d vote. The committee may require that specified conditions be met before the passing recommendation becomes effective. \u00a0On the recommendation of the committee, the Dean may permit a second examination.\u00a0 A third examination is not permitted. \u00a0Failure to complete the degree requirements within five years (departments may specify shorter periods) of passing the preliminary examination requires a new examination. The Graduate College requires the preliminary examination be completed after at least one calendar year of residence and one year prior to the final dissertation defense. Upon completion of all degree requirements and dissertation, the candidate must orally defend the work before the committee. \u00a0Only students in good academic standing are permitted to defend their dissertation.\u00a0 A new Committee Recommendation form must be filed, listing the dissertation title and committee members. \u00a0The chairperson (advisor) is considered the primary reader of the dissertation.\u00a0 A second and/or third member of the committee may also be designated as \u201creaders.\u201d The dissertation committee is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College on the recommendation of the student\u2019s department. \u00a0The Committee Recommendation form is available online through the Graduate College website (http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-student-forms), which must be filled and submitted to the CS Student Affairs office at least three weeks prior to the exam date. \u00a0The committee composition requirements of the final defense committee are the same as the preliminary committee, except the appointment of one member from outside the degree-granting program is mandatory. \u00a0The committee composition of the committee is as follows: Federal regulations require that any research which involves the use of either human subjects or animals be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Animal Care Committee (ACC). The regulations are all-inclusive in that surveys, interviews, pre-existing data and human tissues obtained for non-research purposes require review by the IRB before the research can be done. If the work is completed without IRB or ACC approval, it cannot be published, even as a thesis. Copies of the IRB or ACC approval must be included in the appendix of the final draft of the thesis submitted for review by the Graduate College. It is University policy that theses which are not in compliance with the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (OPRS) will not be accepted for fulfillment of graduation requirements. For further information, see http://grad.uic.edu/office-protection-research-subjects / or contact OPRS. Format Guidelines Thesis and dissertation format guidelines are described in detail in a Thesis Manual published and available on the Graduate College website http://grad.uic.edu/thesis \u00a0A pdf copy of the thesis must be submitted to the CS Student Affairs office via email for a format check one week prior to the deadline set by the Graduate College. CS Graduate Student Processes Course Selection All graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest. \u00a0PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition. \u00a0New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year. Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research. \u00a0Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester. Registration Restrictions* \u2013 CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS. How is it implemented? Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905). \u00a0We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs. *The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed. Other course processes Some 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation. \u00a0If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course. Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester. \u00a0See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships: http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships. \u00a0Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer. \u00a0Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees. The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework. \u00a0Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively. \u00a0 Course Prerequisites If your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses. \u00a0 Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing Courses Students should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms). \u00a0Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes. Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class. \u00a0Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review. As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS). \u00a0If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a \u201clate drop\u201d, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript. \u00a0A \u201cW\u201d cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade. The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: \u201cI have had this material before\u201d, \u201cThis course will not be useful to me\u201d, \u201cI am taking too many courses\u201d, \u201cI do not have the prerequisites\u201d, \u201cI forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline\u201d, \u201cA bad grade will affect my GPA negatively\u201d or \u201cI have not attended classes for the past few weeks\u201d. \u00a0It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites. Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply. Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students. \u00a0In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission. Good Academic Standing In addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty. Grades Coursework earn grades of A, B, C, D or F; research hours a \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018U\u2019. \u00a0GPA is calculated based on the grades and credits hours.\u00a0 For details see: http://grad.uic.edu/grades. Probation and Academic Dismissal All graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 (B) grade point average (GPA). \u00a0The GPA calculation does not include independent study and research courses (CS 590, CS 595-599). Graduate course work must be satisfied by a C grade or higher. \u00a0If a student\u2019s graduate GPA falls below 3.0 (B), the Graduate College will issue a letter of warning and impose academic probation for a specified period of time. \u00a0Failure to comply with the terms will likely result in dismissal from the CS program and Graduate College.\u00a0 Details of this available at: http://grad.uic.edu/probation-and-academic-dismissal. A student on probation is ineligible for department awarded financial aid, recommendation for any type of practical training, or graduation. General Graduation Guidelines Recommended step by step process If you are graduating with a Thesis/Dissertation, you must: If you are graduating with the MS Project option: Final Steps Please note that if you do not graduate in the semester you submitted your \u2018Intent to Graduate\u2019, you have to submit the request again during the term you intend to graduate. \u00a0The previous request will NOT be carried over to the next semester automatically. Petitions The Graduate College is quite firm in its deadlines and will not accept petitions and other forms after the specified deadlines. \u00a0It is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure that petitions are complete; questions regarding them should be directed to (a) Staff in SEO 905, (b) the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), or (c) the Graduate College. Some petitions are available for on-line submission.\u00a0 However, many still require paper forms which require the signatures of your graduate advisor and of the DGS. \u00a0It is your responsibility to secure these signatures in a timely manner to meet the Graduate College deadlines. \u00a0The following procedures should be followed:   Department of Computer Science  851 S.

Be sure to complete the personal statement section of the form.\u00a0 In addition, the following documents, which are usually already on file as part of the admission process, will be required by your program.\u00a0 If you are in doubt about whether a credential may be missing, consult with your program. Instructions/forms for use by Directors of Graduate Studies/program submitters\u00a0(Bluestem protected) Please visit the Fellowship and Awards Deadline page for deadlines established by the Graduate College Awards Committee. The Graduate College \u00a0announced a new funding arrangement for the University Fellowship recipients who will be entering UIC for the Fall of 2015, and going forward. University Fellowships are awards aimed at recruiting outstanding students newly admitted to terminal master's and PhD programs at UIC. Students who have previously been admitted to a graduate program at UIC may be eligible if it can be demonstrated that this award would be part of a genuinely new recruitment effort (transitioning from a MS to a PhD program in the\u00a0same department does not meet this criterion). Students should direct questions about eligibility to their Director of Graduate Studies. Applicants will be reviewed by the Graduate Awards Committee and evaluated for academic excellence on the basis of post-secondary record, letters of recommendation, personal statement, standardized tests, and other criteria as deemed appropriate by the committee, including the recommendation from the nominating program/department. For the sake of this competition, UIC's terminal master's programs are: Architecture (MArch; MS); Architecture in Health Design (MS); Design Criticism (MA); Moving Image, New Media Arts, Photography, Studio Arts MFA; Museum and Exhibition Studies (MA); Biomedical Visualization (MS); MDes (Graphic and Industrial Design); Environmental & Urban Geography (MA); Forensic Science (MS); Forensic Toxicology (MS); French and Francophone Studies (MA); Health Professions Education (MPHE); Latin American & Latino Studies (MA); Occupational Therapy (MS); Spanish (MAT).\u00a0 In the second year (for a master's recipient) and the second and third years (for a doctoral recipient), the student\u2019s academic programs must provide a nine-month, 50% FTE appointment or the equivalent. Students with a 50% teaching or research assistantship will have their stipends topped off up to $22,000 or by a maximum of $6,000.\u00a0 Teaching and research assistantship stipends for these students must be equivalent to those provided to other students in the same department. In the event that a doctoral graduate program has a mechanism for financial support for students during years one and two, the University Fellowship could be deferred to years three and four, provided the student has met the progress requirements described above. Outstanding student applicants for University and Abraham Lincoln recruitment fellowships will be considered for Pipeline to an Inclusive Faculty (PIF) Program. Please click here for more information. Recipients of the University Fellowship will receive a stipend of $22,000 in the first year, or $1,833.33 per month. Fourth year renewals will be funded at the same rate, assuming the student is making satisfactory progress, and has passed their Preliminary Examination. During the first and fourth year of funding from the Graduate College, recipients may accept a part-time assistantship from UIC, only if it is related to their field of study (i.e., student's own research) up to a total of 50% FTE. Work unrelated to the field of study is not allowed.\u00a0 Graduate hourly appointments are also not permitted. Recipients may not hold UIC Abraham Lincoln or Dean's Scholar Fellowships simultaneously with the University Fellowship, nor any external award where it is prohibited by that external funding agency. Other awards may be allowed to be held simultaneously, but must be approved by the Graduate College.\u00a0 It is the student's responsibility to know and understand the regulations of the University Fellowship and those of any other award (see Policies below).  University Fellowship recipients also receive a tuition and fee waiver from the Graduate College. The waiver covers all tuition (including differential, if any) service fee, health service fee, academic facilities maintenance fund assessment, library and information technology assessment, and part of the cost of coverage (see link) for Fall and Spring Semester towards Campus Care, if applicable. All other fees are the responsibility of the student.\u00a0\u00a0 See the Rules and Procedures section above for information related to funding in the second year (for a master's recipient) and the second and third years (for a doctoral recipient). Students supported by these fellowships are required to complete at least 12 semester hours each semester unless expressly authorized by the Dean of the Graduate College to carry a reduced course load. Fellows are not required to register for the summer session by the Graduate College; however, individual departments may require summer registration. Fellows who register in\u00a0the summer must enroll in at least 6 hours to be eligible for a summer tuition waiver. Fellows should check with the department to ensure that summer registration is not required for the degree program. The Graduate College has extablished certain fellowship policies regarding external funding, completion of the Preliminary Examination for renewal, top-off funds during the years not directly funded by the Graduate College, and deferrments of fourth-year Graduate College funding.\u00a0 Please carefully read the Graduate College Fellowship Policies. A fellowship will affect\u00a0federal student\u00a0loan or\u00a0work-study. Typically, students with fellowships may not be permitted to borrow small amounts of federal loans due to cost of attendance regulation. Check with the Office of Student Financial Aid on eligibility requirements. If you have\u00a0already received a refund for the current year in federal loans and you accept a fellowship, you may be responsible to return this refund to UIC. Contact the Office of Student Financial Aid for further information. If applying for loans and/or work-study, a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be completed. See the Graduate Student Guide from the Office of Student Financial Aid for more information. Eligible students may be nominated for a University Fellowship by their programs; self-nominations will not be accepted. Applicants and students should contact their academic program, or program of interest, for clarifications.  not not Applicants and students should contact their academic program, or program of interest, for clarifications. \u00a9 ", "out_links": ["https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/", "https://grad.uic.edu/rss.xml", "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/degree-programs/grad-prof-degree-programs/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/degree-programs/program-updates/", "http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-college-fellowships", "http://grad.uic.edu/university-fellowship-nomination-instructions", "http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-college-fellowship-and-award-deadlines#udf", "http://grad.uic.edu/uic-pipeline-inclusive-faculty-pif-program", "http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-college-tuition-and-fee-waivers", "http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-college-fellowship-policies", "http://www.vcsa.uic.edu/MainSite/departments/financial_aid/home/", "http://www.vcsa.uic.edu/MainSite/departments/financial_aid/home/", "http://www.vcsa.uic.edu/MainSite/departments/financial_aid/home/", "http://uic.edu", "https://my.uic.edu/", "http://www.uic.edu", "https://grad.uic.edu/rss.xml", "https://grad.uic.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?target=http%3A%2F%2Fgrad.uic.edu%2F%3Fq%3Dshib_login%2Fnode%2F963"]}, "http://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/course-descriptions/cs": {"text": "CS\u00a0401.

An important network management task is configuring a network\u2019s \u201ccontrol plane\u201d. The control plane governs how the network moves data around, and plays a critical role in imposing important security and compliance policies, such as, who can/not communicate, which communications to prioritize or isolate, etc. Typical control planes are composed of several distributed routing protocol configurations spread across many hundreds of network devices. Unfortunately, this complexity often leads to configuration bugs that cause large-scale outages, blackholes, and isolation breaches. In this talk, I will survey recent advances that are transforming the field of network management from the ground up. These techniques, inspired by formal methods, aim to automate key network management tasks, and systematically improve resilience, and trustworthiness of networks. These techniques automatically verify whether networks satisfy important properties; synthesize networks with provably correct policies realizations; and repair broken networks with minimal or no human involvement. In the limit, these advances lead to \u201czero touch\u201d networking. The impact of this confluence of formal methods and networking is transforming not just management but other big portions of the field of networking into a science. It is leading to new approaches to designing network hardware, topologies, protocols, and software from precise high-level specifications and with strong provable guarantees. I will survey emerging ideas in these directions as well. Aditya Akella is a Professor of Computer Sciences and an H. I. Romnes Faculty Fellow at UW-Madison. He received his B.

of computer science students from universities across the country take a victory\u00a0pose after the MIT Energy Hack November 2-4. Chirag Soni (MS \u201919) spent an intense weekend at his first hackathon, MIT Energy Hack 2018, competing with teams involving participants from all around the globe. The challenge:\u00a0Hacking MIT\u2019s Smart Sensor!: Reduce GHG emissions with Machine Learning. His hard work over the weekend paid off as he and his team were awarded two prizes: 3rd place overall and an award for addressing a Problem Statement through the MIT Office of Sustainability. Soni was the lone UIC representative at the hackathon, teaming up with students from Stanford, Northeastern and North Carolina State University to form their team MassSave.\u00a0Soni\u2019s team developed a\u00a0Building Management System (BMS) to hack MIT\u2019s Smart Sensor using a\u00a0Machine Learning model and a\u00a0Deep Reinforcement Learning model. \u201cIt was a great experience to participate, trying to solve the most challenging problems that companies are facing in the industry,\u201d said Soni.\u00a0 \u201cA big shout-out to my team MassSave involving these amazing people I worked with and without whom it wouldn\u2019t have been possible!\u201d The hackathon was organized by the MIT Energy Club and hosted on MIT\u2019s campus in Cambridge, MA.

That was the experience for\u00a0Anusha Pai (BS \u201919) and Daisy Arellano (BS \u201919) during their software engineering internships this past summer in California. Anusha was at Google in Mountain View while Daisy completed her internship at Macy\u2019s Technology in San Francisco. They each shared details from their experience. Anusha Pai | Google Securing the internship: I found out about the internship through the Grace Hopper Conference (fall 2017). Best part of the internship: Working on a project with an amazing group of talent would have to be the best part of my internship. I also loved that the project I worked on has a large-scale impact on many users. Most challenging part of the internship: This was my second internship at Google, so I was more comfortable with the internal tools, the work environment/culture, and the campus. However, during my first Google internship, I felt overwhelmed with the large campus and all the training in the first week, which was very challenging for me, but with the help of my team, I was able to complete the training and\u00a0learn lots of new things during my internship successfully. Most valuable thing learned that was not CS or engineering related: I learned that networking with as many people as you can is very important in your career. During my internship, there were a lot of intern events and team events that motivated us to build connections and get to know the team a little better. Surprising part of internship: I was surprised how truly caring every single coworker is and how motivating everyone is to each other. It was exactly like I heard it would be like. The environment and work culture is very positive and caring, and the company truly believes in each individual\u2019s success. The Google community is like one big family who helps each other out in all situations, which is one of the many reasons I loved interning there. Evaluation of overall experience: My overall experience was unforgettable! I have been so fortunate and blessed to be a part of the Google community. I received a warm welcome, great support, had a fantastic time, and learned tons during my internship. If they offered a full-time position: My internship experience at Google was very positive, and I loved working there every single day over the summer with such an incredible group of people. I would love to work at Google again and would definitely accept a full-time offer from them. Daisy Arellano | Macy\u2019s Technology Securing the internship: I was recruited through the Grace Hopper 2017 conference which I attended with the UIC computer science department. Best part of the internship: Being able to explore a different city, and meeting new people within my field. Networking with people across the company and learning how ecommerce works. Most challenging part of the internship: I think the hardest part of my internship was becoming comfortable and confident enough within my team to ask questions and ask for resources I needed. Most valuable thing learned that was not CS or engineering related: I learned how different working for a tech company in ecommerce is than a tech company that focuses only on tech. This was valuable because I realized I really like the business applications and emphasis on the customer that companies like Macy\u2019s focus on and that I will probably want to work for a company much like this one. Surprising part of the internship: I was surprised by how much the company cared about making sure I had a fun experience. There was a lot more downtime than I expected allocated just for us to network and enjoy San Francisco. Evaluating overall experience: It was an amazing experience, I learned so much about myself and how I work with a team and how I work as a programmer. If they offered a full-time position: Accepting the offer would mean relocating and I have family and friends here. I also love Chicago and would like to stay for a while after I graduate. If I get an offer I will have lots to think about but it is definitely a possibility! Additional comments: I was very nervous about my first internship as I usually work with teams at UIC that I am fairly familiar with but everyone was so focused on making sure I learned as much as possible and was so helpful. For anyone who is nervous about their first internship I encourage you to research the company because while I had a great experience I know many people who did not and it really does make a difference.

The project aims to complement available campus computing resources via the campus\u2019s research network. It will be able to\u00a0access local and remote computing and storage facilities funded, including XSEDE, Blue Waters, Deep Learning Instrument and Chameleon. This critical instrumentation will\u00a0provide a platform to pursue fundamental science and engineering research training in deep learning (data mining and data analytics, computer vision, natural language\u00a0processing, artificial intelligence), visualization (simulation, rendering, visual analytics, video steaming, image processing), and a combination of deep learning and\u00a0visualization (e.g., when data is so large that it cannot be easily visualized, then deep learning is used to extract features of interest to be visualized). The instrumentation\u00a0also enables investigation and contribution to societal issues in disciplines such as anthropology, biology, cybersecurity, data-literacy, fraud detection, healthcare,\u00a0manufacturing, urban sustainability, and cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous cars). Its design utilizes state-of-the-art computer architecture, known as composable architecture, in which the computer\u2019s components (traditional processor, GPU, storage, and\u00a0networking) form a fluid pool of resources, such that different applications with different workflows can be run simultaneously, with each configuring the resources it requires\u00a0almost instantaneously, at any time. Given composable infrastructure scalability and agility, it is more beneficial than traditional clouds and clusters that are rigid,\u00a0overprovisioned, and expensive. \u00a0    Notice:  get_currentuserinfo is deprecated since version 4.5.0!

Both Zheleva and Kanich share an interest in online data and privacy as their main areas of research.

Although the data being saved in online archives does not change, the personal and social contexts surrounding them do. Those life changes may necessitate changing or deleting stored data but, unfortunately, the vast quantity of data in users\u2019 online archives makes manual management infeasible. The goal of this project is to develop methods and tools that enable users to manage the data they have accumulated over many years, leveraging user-centered design and machine learning to partially automate the process . . .
