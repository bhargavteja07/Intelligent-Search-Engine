The Department of Computer Science degree requirements are outlined below. Students should consult the College of Engineering section for additional degree requirements and college academic policies. The Joint Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) is designed for undergraduate students with outstanding academic performance who desire to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science, or who wish to prepare themselves for advanced placement in the workplace. Students will earn both a BSCS and an MSCS degree upon completion, with 8 hours of course work shared between the two degrees. The requirements for completion of the combined BSCS/MSCS degree are identical to the completion of these two separate degrees; however, there are 8 hours of shared course work used for both degrees. Completion of 120 hours at the undergraduate level; plus 8 shared hours counting toward both the BSCS and MSCS degrees; plus 28 hours of course work at the graduate level will result in joint BSCS/MSCS degrees. Students in the BSCS who have only two semesters of course work left and who have at least a 3.60/4.00 grade point average may register for two graduate-level courses (one at the 400 level, and one at the 500 level) and receive 4 hours, instead of 3 hours, for each. The graduate-level courses taken in the senior year will be used at the undergraduate level to fulfill 8 hours of BS selective requirements. At the graduate level these courses will count as required courses. An advisor must approve these courses. Students should apply to the program during their third year, after having completed at least 27 credit hours of CS courses (excluding CS\u00a0398). An overall GPA of 3.60 or higher is required for application. Apply Online | Contact Admissions | Privacy Statement\n        Having problems accessing this site?

The speed with which individual computer processors have grown faster and more efficient has slowed down in recent years due to physical limitations. To get around this apparent speed limit, hardware designers have resorted to designing computer chips that contain multiple independent processors, also known as cores. The resulting machine is known as a multi-core computer. This work-around is limited by the need to coordinate activities between processors, currently done using what\u2019s called a lock. When a program uses multiple cores concurrently, there are times when a critical piece of information or data needs to be modified before the next step in computing can take place. To prevent multiple chips from accessing that shared resource simultaneously \u2013 which could lead to errors \u2013 the data is temporarily \u201clocked,\u201d meaning that only one core can handle and modify it at a time. But locking can be slow. The chip must first \u201cacquire\u201d the lock, or send signals to all the other chips that the data it needs to modify is off-limits; then it does what it needs to do with that data, before finally releasing the lock, making it available to other processors in the computer. \u201cThis method of locking shared data is known as synchronized access, which can be highly inefficient,\u201d said Jakob Eriksson, associate professor of computer science in the UIC College of Engineering and principal investigator on the grant. Eriksson and his students will refine an alternative approach to handling shared data resources on multi-core computers. \u201cInstead of synchronization or locking, we are looking at another way of computing called delegation,\u201d Eriksson said. In delegation, a single core acts as a server whose sole job it is to deal with data that needs to be shared among processors. While delegation often comes with a higher initial cost in terms of time needed, ultimately, performance can be much faster than with locking on modern computers. \u201cConsider the analogy of a family doing dishes,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cThe locking approach is inefficient: each family member opens the tap, squirts some soap, washes one dish, closes the tap, dries their hands and then waits for their turn to use the sink again. With the delegation approach, the family members hand their dishes to a single designated washer who uses a pre-filled sink of soapy water and quickly does the dishes for everybody. For a single shared resource \u2013 in this analogy that\u2019s the sink \u2013 with many users contending for it, delegation is always more efficient.\u201d In previous research, Eriksson\u2019s group showed that an efficient delegation system can dramatically outperform locking-based methods on processes that need shared access to individual items of data. They found that delegation is 10 times faster than using a lock-based processing system. Under the new grant, Eriksson will continue to refine delegation-based processing by identifying and eliminating roadblocks to additional gains in processing speed, and by adapting delegation to work in a wider range of settings. \u00a0 \n\nContact\n\nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nFeatured Academic Research, Research \n \nSharon Parmet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-413-2695\nsparmet@uic.edu\n Categories \nFeatured Academic Research, Research  Topics computer, computer science, processing Sharon Parmet | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/07/kaitlyn-baker-422999-unsplash.jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/author/sparmet", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-acadresearch", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-research", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/computer-science", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/processing", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff": {"text": "\n                Read about the journeys these six students took to their Dec. 15 commencement                                  Read more \u2192\n \n                UIC Office of Preparedness and Response is collecting new toys for kids in need                                   Read more \u2192\n \n                Dear Faculty and Staff, This weekend will be a very...

For some kids, it was the first time they learned to use a glove and practice alongside a Major League Baseball player. Others experienced their very first college tour. It\u2019s the fifth year that Curtis Granderson has brought his Grand Kids Academy All-Star Camp to the state-of-the-art field complex at UIC. The daylong event gets city kids moving and learning about the value of sports, teamwork, healthy foods and going to college. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different people that have helped me get to the point of where I am today,\u201d said Granderson, a 2003 graduate of the College of Business Administration and current outfielder for the Toronto Blue Jays. Granderson said he considers UIC his home before mentioning that student-athletes from Lansing\u2019s Thornton Fractional South High School \u2014 his hometown high school \u2014 were in attendance to teach participants the basics of slugging, throwing, pitching and fielding. \u201cI want to definitely \u2014 if I get the opportunity \u2014 come back and always help out,\u201d Granderson said. For the majority of his career, the three-time all-star has done just that: used his prominence as an MLB player to fuel youth education and sports initiatives, including his own nonprofit, the Grand Kids Foundation. At UIC, his historic $5 million donation funded construction of Curtis Granderson Stadium. He has raised millions more to make a positive impact off the field, which earned him the 2016 MLB\u2019s Roberto Clemente Award and other prestigious recognition for his community involvement and philanthropy like the MLB Players Association\u2019s Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award. But in Chicago July 18, his focus was the city\u2019s underserved children. \u201cThis program is targeting Chicago\u2019s most in need,\u201d said Christina Coleman, a board member of the Grand Kids Foundation. Participants ate healthy meals at the camp, thanks to a partnership between the foundation and the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Called Grand Giving, the initiative provides free meals to local youth in the summer. Afterward, campers were welcomed on a tour of the UIC campus to help them imagine life at college and beyond. \u201cThese things really go a long way,\u201d said Bo Porter, director of player development for the Major League Baseball Players Association. \u201cWhen kids know that people care about them. It gives them just an added motivation to actually go out and do great things.\u201d Photos: Jenny Fontaine \n\nContact\n\nFrancisca Corona\n\nfcoron3@uic.edu\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nFeatured Campus \n \nFrancisca Corona\n\nfcoron3@uic.edu\n Categories \nFeatured Campus  Topics baseball, Curtis Granderson, Granderson Stadium, Major League Baseball, MLB Francisca Corona | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson009", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson064", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson107", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson134", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson174", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson179", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson005", "https://today.uic.edu/2018-curtisgranderson001", "https://today.uic.edu/author/fcoron3", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/baseball", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/curtis-granderson", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/granderson-stadium", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/major-league-baseball", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/mlb", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "https://today.uic.edu/uics-chancellors-fellows-program-targets-stellar-illinois-students": {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOctober 4, 2018\t\t\t UIC\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Fellows Program is designed to recruit and retain highly qualified students from Illinois.

High achieving Illinois high school students will have the opportunity to have a free college education at the University of Illinois at Chicago under a new scholarship beginning next fall, designated the UIC Chancellor\u2019s Fellows Program. En espa\u00f1ol The Illinois legislature has created the AIM HIGH program and earmarked $25 million to Illinois public universities, of which $3.8 million will go to UIC beginning in the 2019-2020 school year. This statewide initiative is an effort to increase enrollment of Illinois residents at Illinois public universities. UIC will match the funds it receives from the state in order to fully fund the Chancellor\u2019s Fellows Program. \u201cWe want these accomplished students at UIC because of the exceptional dedication and discipline they have shown during their high school years. We are thankful to state officials for providing the resources to retain these excellent students in Illinois and help them realize their dreams,\u201d said UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. \u201cThis program provides support for top Illinois high school students to take advantage of the excellent education and the diverse environment of UIC.\u201d The program is open to Illinois residents who are also U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens and who come from families with a household income no greater than six times the federal poverty rate, as indicated in the relevant AIM HIGH legislation. They must be first-time college students with a minimum unweighted high school grade point average of 3.8 and a minimum SAT score of 1360 or minimum ACT score of 30. High school valedictorians are also eligible, without reference to grade point average and standardized test scores. Students must apply to UIC by the university\u2019s Nov. 1 early action deadline. Eligible students will also receive priority consideration for admission into the UIC Honors College. \u201cThe purpose of UIC\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Fellows Program is to recruit and retain highly qualified students from Illinois and to give these students the opportunity and resources to succeed,\u201d said Kevin Browne, vice provost for academic and enrollment services. \u201cAs UIC has shown through our increasing enrollment numbers and rankings, there is great momentum at this university. With the AIM HIGH commitment supported by state officials, UIC will aggressively recruit these outstanding Illinois students and provide them with a first-rate education that prepares them intellectually and socially to thrive in their lives and careers.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n\n\n \nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n Categories \nCampus, Featured Campus  Topics awards, chancellor Carlos Sadovi | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/hispanic-enrollment-up-graduation-rates-rise/dg14_09_21_123-jpg", "https://today.uic.edu/programa-de-becas-del-rector-de-la-uic-enfoca-a-estelares-estudiantes-de-illinois", "https://today.uic.edu/author/csadovi", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/featured-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/awards", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/chancellor", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "http://economicimpact.uic.edu": {"text": "We recommend using the latest version of IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox or Safari.

(Photo: Jacqueline Carey) \u201cToday we\u2019re going back to breakfast,\u201d Lindsey Strieter tells a group of middle school students in the Altus Academy cafeteria. \u201cDo you remember why breakfast is important?\u201d asks Michelle Reich. The second- through eighth-grade students\u2019 answers are, for the most part, correct. \u201cIt makes you healthy,\u201d says one student. \u201cIt keeps your body strong,\u201d says another. A third student interrupts to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s that green stuff?\u201d Strieter, a clinical instructor in the College of Applied Health Sciences, and Reich, a registered dietitian and UIC alumna, are kicking off the day\u2019s lesson in the UIC Health and Wellness Academy, a program of the college\u2019s physical therapy department that collaborates with schools in Chicago to teach kids about healthy decision-making and encourage healthy behaviors. Eating breakfast is the focus of the lesson because Strieter and the 13 UIC students running the wellness academy have noticed that this healthy behavior is one many of the Altus students ignore. The \u201cgreen stuff,\u201d the kids learn, is the spinach they will use to make a healthy breakfast smoothie. \u201cThe lessons we teach in the Health and Wellness Academy are built by UIC students to address the needs, likes and dislikes of the kids from partnering schools,\u201d Strieter said. UIC alumna Michelle Reich (center) helps middle school students make a breakfast smoothie during the UIC Health and Wellness Academy. (Photo: Jacqueline Carey) And it\u2019s exactly that \u2014 the personalized lessons \u2014 that makes the wellness academy such a valuable program for the participating schools and the UIC students. \u201cThere are so many programs out there for teachers and after-school programs that focus on weight and BMI, but those programs have two problems,\u201d Strieter said. \u201cFirst, they lack a focus on actually improving behavior. Second, they place a significant burden on school teachers, who are already overworked. \u201cThis program looks different in every school,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s based off an educational model that is specific to learners. It also leverages our UIC students as program instructors \u2014 this is valuable experience for the UIC students in developing educational materials and communicating about health, and it\u2019s necessary help for partnering schools.\u201d Altus Academy, an independent, private, not-for-profit school, is the second school to work with UIC\u2019s Health and Wellness Academy, which first launched in 2016 with Smyth Elementary School, a public Magnet school in Chicago. Thirty-two UIC students are currently involved in the program at Smyth. Altus, which does not charge its students tuition, serves the North and South Lawndale communities. Altus principal and founder John Heybach says the wellness academy fits nicely with his school\u2019s focus on the community and family unit and the needs of his students. \u201cOur students often face many barriers to success,\u201d Heybach said. \u201cThey live in low-income, challenging neighborhoods and they are members of underrepresented communities \u2014 our responsibility is to create a better pathway to success for them, and we take that to heart in our holistic approach to education.\u201d UIC kinesiology student Kathryn Marie Garrido (center) leads a small group of Altus Academy students in a self-esteem-building exercise. (Photo: Jacqueline Carey) Just one floor below the breakfast lesson in the cafeteria, another group of Altus students is participating in similar wellness and physical activity lessons. Kathryn Marie Garrido, a senior in the kinesiology program, asks a small group of students to sit in a circle. \u201cPlease look at the person next to you. I want you to write down one nice thing about that person and pass your paper to them,\u201d Garrido says. Julie Niewiadomska, also a kinesiology student, helps the kids plant vegetables for the Altus garden. Nearby, Mariana Reyes is helping the middle school students put together skits that highlight healthy behaviors. Reyes, a UIC senior entering the occupational therapy program in the fall, has passed out three prompts to the students, who have broken into groups and developed and performed the skits. \u201cRemember the skit about the jumping jacks app \u2014 what things were influencing you?\u201d she asks. \u201cWas it peers? Was it technology? What else?\u201d Reyes\u2019 questions relate directly to the lessons she is learning as part of her UIC coursework. \u201cWe are teaching our UIC students how to be health advocates and educators, and one of the elements we teach is how to leverage established\u00a0educational standards,\u201d Strieter said. \u201cOne in particular we use to develop the wellness academy lessons is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Health Education Standards.\u201d UIC kinesiology student Julie Niewiadomska (left) helps middle school student in the UIC Health and Wellness Academy plant vegetables for the Altus Academy garden. (Photo: Jacqueline Carey) Standard Two from the CDC advises that students should learn to analyze the various influences on health behavior, from media and technology to friends and family. Students in the College of Applied Health Sciences participate as mentors and facilitators in the Health and Wellness Academy by registering for the elective course, which provides three credit hours toward their degrees. The course, offered in fall and spring semesters, consists of one day of lecture and three different lab practicum options in which the students work with Chicago schools. Reyes says working with the program is helping her figure out what age patients she would like to work with as an occupational therapist. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet if I want to work with kids in my career, but this experience is helping me to understand what that might be like and gain needed hours interacting with the community,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThe kids love it,\u201d said Heybach, \u201cbecause they get to have fun.\u201d Strieter says the department hopes to expand the program in the future. \u201cAs long as we have interest from students and from schools this is a powerful way to impact the health and longevity of our community,\u201d Strieter said. \u201cThe program was built to be scalable, and we\u2019re excited to see where it takes us.\u201d When asked what his favorite class is, Isaiah, a second-grade Altus student said, \u201cMath. No, wait. Is this a class? This one is my favorite.\u201d Maybe, he\u2019ll even start eating breakfast. \n\nContact\n\nJacqueline Carey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-8277\njmcarey@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/JCareyUIC\n\n\n \nJacqueline

first-ever graduate degree in city design when the University of Illinois at Chicago launches a new program next fall. The master of city design degree, based in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will offer an interdisciplinary learning experience that blends elements of architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and other creative fields. Students will experience intensive city-based courses and studios that provide immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice. \u201cThe master of city design expands the portfolio of degree offerings by the college, reflecting the changing needs of cities and metropolitan regions,\u201d said Michael Pagano, dean of the college. \u201cThat the degree is offered in the center of a global city makes it an exceptionally attractive program for professionals who are looking to enhance their skill set.\u201d Serving as director designate for the program is Sanjeev Vidyarthi, whose own training and professional experience combines architecture, urban design and spatial planning. Sanjeev Vidyarthi, UIC associate professor of urban planning and policy and director designate of the master of city design program. \u201cThe master of city design program not only showcases the university\u2019s Great Cities Commitment, but is also well-positioned to produce reflective designers equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills to face the complex challenges of an increasingly urban world,\u201d said Vidyarthi, associate professor of urban planning and policy. The program will prepare students for career opportunities at planning and design consulting firms and related work with governments, foundations, community organizations and public sector agencies. It will also enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design. Graduates of the program will be desirable to prospective employers for their \u201cability to conceive urban public spaces and civic improvement projects by focusing on the physical design aspects of spatial relationships and interactions between people and places,\u201d Vidyarthi said. The program\u2019s courses will be taught by faculty and urban scholars from UIC research centers such as the Great Cities Institute and Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, and accomplished practitioners from Chicago\u2019s leading design firms. The 38-credit-hour degree can be completed in one year of full-time study. Applications are due Feb. 15 for international applicants and March 15 for domestic applicants. To be considered for a limited number of departmental scholarships, applicants should apply by Jan. 15. In addition to the new degree, the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers two bachelor\u2019s degrees in urban studies and public policy, along with master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in urban planning and policy as well as public administration. Certificate programs in geospatial analysis and visualization, and public transit planning and management are also available. More information about the master of city design degree is available online or contact Vidyarthi at svidy@uic.edu or (312) 355-0309. \n\nContact\n\nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n\n\n \nBrian Flood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-996-7681\nbflood@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/bflooduic\n Categories \nCampus, Students  Topics cities, College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, degree programs, design, master's degree, spatial planning Brian Flood | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design/col-cuppa-main-lockb-sm-red", "https://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design/sanjeev-vidyarthi-2", "https://today.uic.edu/author/bflood", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/cities", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/college-of-urban-planning-and-public-affairs", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/degree-programs", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/design", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/masters-degree", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/spatial-planning", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "https://today.uic.edu/events/winter-clothing-drive-for-el-rescate": {"text": " \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLoading Map....\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nUIC Gender and Sexuality Center Gallery1007 W.

CKD affects more than 26 million people in the United States. People with the condition experience gradual loss of kidney function. In severe cases or when left untreated, CKD causes kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a transplant for survival. The study, which is published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, included nearly 4,000 individuals \u2014 1,778 women and 2,161 men \u2014 who were enrolled in the ongoing, multicenter\u00a0Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. The UIC researchers analyzed the incidence of end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trends \u2014 a key marker of kidney health \u2014 and death, and compared them by sex. At a median follow-up of seven years, the rate of ESRD per 100 people was 3.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The corresponding rates of death were 2.6 and 3.6, respectively. Dr. Ana Ricardo (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) \u201cWe found that women had 17 percent lower risk of experiencing ESRD and the risk of death was 31 percent lower in women than in men,\u201d said Dr. Ana Ricardo, lead author of the study. These differences persisted after adjustments for observed sex-related disparities in lifestyle and medical management, and after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, baseline kidney function, medications, and cardiovascular and metabolic factors. Ricardo said the findings were particularly striking, as they observed men were more likely to be on kidney-protective medications. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that women are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, but there has been conflicting research on CKD outcomes by sex,\u201d said Ricardo, associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. \u201cThis is the first study to analyze data from a large, representative sample of prospectively enrolled patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease. \u201cThe results of this study suggest that biology and psychosocial factors may be the driver of the sex-related disparity observed in patients with CKD,\u201d Ricardo said. Ricardo hopes the study increases public and care provider awareness of the higher risk of kidney failure and death among men. Funding for the CRIC Study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from the\u00a0National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963 and U01DK060902).

Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity and seizures, affects more than 65 million people worldwide. About one-third have difficulty controlling their seizures even with medication. Seizures can interfere with work, relationships and the ability to live independently. Previous research has shown that living in neighborhoods with high rates of crime have significantly higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\u00a0Stress is also a factor that is commonly reported to trigger seizures in people with epilepsy. The UIC study included 63 adults with epilepsy living within the city limits of Chicago who were participating in a larger study testing the efficacy of a tablet-based educational tool that provides tailored information about epilepsy. That study, called PAUSE, involves patients at the University of Illinois Hospital\u2019s epilepsy clinic and in the Chicagoland community and is facilitated by the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago. The researchers determined the levels of crime in neighborhoods of the 63 participants by mapping their ZIP codes to specific neighborhoods and then cross-referencing those neighborhoods with local crime rates available through the City of Chicago Police data portal. Participants self-reported the number of seizures they had in the past month and in the past three months. \u201cWe found that people living with epilepsy who live in high-crime neighborhoods experienced significantly more seizures,\u201d said Jessica Levy, a research coordinator in the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation who presented the findings. \u201cOn average, people in high-crime neighborhoods had three seizures versus one for people living in low-crime neighborhoods when we looked back over the last 30 days. Over the course of 90 days, people in high-crime neighborhoods had seven seizures on average compared to three for those living in low-crime neighborhoods, so the link between crime and seizure activity is significant.\u201d The researchers found no overall association between neighborhood crime status and the duration of epilepsy or between crime status and poverty. Having more seizures can significantly lower quality of life. Seizures that result in falls can cause bruising or even broken bones. There can also be a stigma associated with having a seizure in public. \u201cUnderstanding the impact of violence and crime as potential triggers for seizures underscores the need for further research that might allow clinicians to make better-informed recommendations for self-management education and stress management skills,\u201d said Dr. Dilip Pandey, associate professor of neurology and rehabilitation at UIC and an investigator on the study. Katharine Ozenberger is a co-investigator on the study. The PAUSE study is conducted through the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation by Dr. Dilip Pandey and Dr. Jeffery Loeb. PAUSE is supported by the University of Illinois Prevention Research Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network under CDC cooperative agreement no.

The SFS (Scholarships for Service) in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance - Recipients receive tuition and a $20,000 annual stipend and after graduation must work in cybersecurity for a number of years equal to the number of years that they received the scholarship. This is open to both BS and MS students. 5-year duration, September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2017. The program supports junior and senior students interested in cyber-security and electronic security courses.  Contact Prof. Venkat (venkat @ uic.edu) for details. Graduate college site on 'Funding your Education' is a good place to start on understanding funding your education in general. They give general information on all types of funding and how to go about finding it. The CS department has teaching assistantships (TA), research assistantships (RA), tution fee waivers (TFW) and department endorsed fellowships offered by the graduate college. Teaching Assistantship applications are available, through the student affairs office, at the end of Fall/Spring semester for the following semester/academic year to continuing graduate students. Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members and we encourage you to contact the faculty in your research interests for availability. Limited number of tution waivers from the graduate college are available for the department each semester, applications for these are the same as for TA. Graduate college has a number of Fellowships for continuing students that have to be endorsed by the department. The fellowships indicated below are required to be submitted and/or sponsored by the director of graduate studies (DGS) and so the deadline for these is weeks/days ahead of the graduate college deadline. All deadlines indicated are department deadlines, by which all necessary application materials and recommendation lettes have to be submitted to the DGS/Student Affairs Office. US Citizens and Immigrants should contact the UIC Financial Aid Office for information on student loans and grants. There are several forms of financial aid available to incoming graduate students.   UIC University Fellowship One of the most prestigious and thus the most competitive form of financial aid is the UIC University Fellowship. The department has to nominate applicants for this award. To be considered for nomination to the University Fellowship, your application must be complete by and ready for review by mid January. These deadlines are strictly enforced. Teaching Assistantship Teaching Assistantships are awarded to applicants with outstanding academic records, in addition to proven communication skills. TA\u2019s assist in the teaching and grading of course work under the supervision and direction of an assigned instructor. Decisions regarding TA\u2019s for the Fall semester are typically made mid March. Awarded applicants are contacted via email. A typical award of this type is a 50% appointment which requires the student to work 20 hours/week of their TA duties. The stipend for this award was $18,229 for the 2016-17 academic year. In addition the award carries a waiver of tuition, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable. All other fees are the responsibility of the student. Research Assistantship Research assistantships are awarded by individual faculty members based on their needs and available research funding. RA\u2019s assist faculty in funded research projects.  Applicants interested in these should contact faculty (link to faculty page) in their area of research directly after being admitted by the department.  Be selective in your correspondence to only the faculty whose research interests match your own; faculty are generally non-responsive to \"broadcast\" appeals for financial aid.  Stipend is similar to teaching assistantship Tuition and Fee Waiver A limited number of Tuition and Fee waivers are available on a competitive basis for PhD students. These cover the cost of all tuition (including differential), service fee, health service fee, academic facilities maintenance fund assessment, library and information technology assessment, and 40% of CampusCare insurance fee in Fall and Spring semsters, if applicable.

For more than 30 years, students attending Ross Edman\u2019s art history classes at the University of Illinois at Chicago could expect to see him in his signature bow ties, share a laugh at his witty repartee and learn from his expertise in art. While Edman died in 2017, the beloved teacher made sure that future generations will continue to have the opportunities to share his artistic love and benefit from his role as a mentor by bequeathing nearly $1 million to establish a merit-based award for graduate-level art history students. The award comes from the estate of Edman, who died at 80, and of his longtime partner, Jon Waltz, who preceded him in death in 2004. The two also left a nearly $1 million bequest to the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, where Waltz also spent three decades as a law school professor. The UIC award will allow the department of art history to recruit the brightest and most qualified applicants to the program, said Martha Pollak, professor and chair of the department of art history. \u201cThe fact that we can offer a named fellowship to a graduate student will raise the visibility of the program,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cIt means that the future of the graduate program is on even better footing.\u201d Edman, who was known for his expertise in Asian art, joined UIC in 1965 while the campus was still located at Navy Pier, and taught until 1995. He also served as an Honors College fellow and became an emeritus faculty member after his retirement. Edman, whose father worked in the U.S. Department of State, spent long periods of time in Europe, where he developed his love of art. He attended Harvard University and earned his master\u2019s degree in art history from Oberlin College. In addition to all of the classes he taught over the years, he was the first professor to offer classes on Asian art. His dedication to his students earned him the Silver Circle Award for Excellence in Teaching. He would bring his beloved pair of Pekinese dogs to campus, offering welcome cheer to students and faculty, according to his former colleagues. While living in Chicago with his partner, Edman became a noted appraiser of art and antiques. He and Waltz later retired to their weekend home in Holland, Michigan, where he loved to garden, cook, read and write long letters to friends. \u201cHis bequest to the department of art history is only the last expression of his generosity and engagement with our students,\u201d said Pollak. Leslie Wooden is the first recipient of the Ross Edman award. (Photo: Jenny Fontaine) The first recipient of the award was Leslie Wooden, who began working this fall on her doctorate in art history with a concentration in gender and women\u2019s studies. Wooden, who is from Washington, D.C., has two master\u2019s degrees from New York University and a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Colorado in Denver. The award helped her concentrate on her studies and research as she acclimated to the city. She said what made the award especially valuable to her was when she researched Edman and really understood how special he was to his students and to the university. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to receive this award in my first semester at UIC,\u201d Wooden said. \u201cThe endowment that Ross Edman and his partner bequeathed is especially significant because UIC is a public institution and this award supports students from all socio-economic backgrounds who like to conduct research but may not have access to outside funding.\u201d Virginia Miller, an associate professor emerita, who first met Edman in 1977 when she came to UIC as a visiting lecturer, remembers him as a gracious teacher who rewarded good work by his students. Miller, a former chair of the department of art history who retired from the university in 2015, remained in contact with him. She remembers him as being so dedicated and knowledgeable about Western and Asian art that he would jump in and \u201cteach everything.\u201d In addition, he was very supportive of young faculty, especially women at a time when this support was most needed. \u201cHe really genuinely liked the students and liked being with them,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe was really interested in the students and he was a very good teacher, that\u2019s his main legacy.\u201d \n\nContact\n\nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n\n\n \nCarlos Sadovi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t312-355-2491\ncsadovi@uic.edu\ntwitter.com/@carlossadoviuic\n Categories \nCampus, Faculty, Students, Uncategorized  Topics art, awards, I am UIC, Silver Circle Carlos Sadovi | ", "out_links": ["http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news", "https://today.uic.edu/academics-research", "https://today.uic.edu/events", "https://today.uic.edu/resources", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/current-students", "https://today.uic.edu/resources/faculty-staff", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper", "https://today.uic.edu/contact", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/sending-massmails-dddh", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/ross-edman-stripes-and-dots", "https://today.uic.edu/leslie-woodenphoto-jenny-fontaine-2", "https://today.uic.edu/author/csadovi", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-campus", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-faculty", "https://today.uic.edu/category/category-students", "https://today.uic.edu/category/uncategorized", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/art", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/awards", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/i-am-uic-2", "https://today.uic.edu/tag/silver-circle", "http://uic.edu", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/social-media-directory", "https://today.uic.edu/experts-guide", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/advertising", "https://today.uic.edu/contact/communicating-on-campus/submit-announcements", "https://today.uic.edu/submit-an-event", "https://today.uic.edu/campus-news/campus-newspaper/subscribe-to-uic-today", "http://uic.edu/", "http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/", "http://www.uic.edu/apps/departments-az/search", "http://disabilityresources.uic.edu/", "http://emergency.uic.edu/", "http://events.uic.edu/", "http://uic.edu/about/job-opportunities", "http://library.uic.edu/", "http://maps.uic.edu/", "http://dos.uic.edu/studentveteranaffairs.shtml"]}, "https://www.cs.uic.edu/graduate-admissions": {"text": "The Department of Computer Science offers graduate programs leading to degrees at the master\u2019s and doctoral levels.

Email:  recruit@cs.uic.edu Phone: call Elena or Christina at (312) 413-4950 The Open House information will apply to both categories of entering students. Transfer students should also see the engineering transfer student school guides.  We have various starting points in our program, accommodating both students who have never taken computer science courses as well as students who already have an extensive background.  Though content is geared primarily towards students, participating in an Open House will give you a good perspective on Computer Science in general and our program in particular.  No, there is no cost, nor are you obligated in any way. This is simply an opportunity for you to learn more about what it would be like to study CS at UIC.  For Computer Science Open House events that are on the same date as university-wide events, we encourage you to attend the university and college portions as well, however you may attend only the Computer Science portion if you are already familiar with the university and the college. If this is the case, please include a comment to this effect when you register.  See this website.  The Computer Science Department is one of six departments within the College of Engineering, which in turn is one of many colleges that are part of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). If you would like information on the College as a whole, visit the\u00a0College of Engineering website.\u00a0Often the College as a whole has recruiting events of which we in Computer Science are a part, which is why you may receive two different letters.  The Computer Science undergraduate programs page has helpful information. here is a great variety of research being done, including network security, intelligent tutoring systems, and uses of technology in education. Many open house sessions include a lab tour of the Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL), which has samples of its work on the EVLTube youtube channel.   Department of Computer Science  851 S.

We are one of the leading research departments at UIC, with annual research funding exceeding $9 million. Five of our professors have won UIC\u2019s top teaching prize, the Award for Excellence in Teaching, awarded to only three to five professors from the entire UIC campus each year. We have about 850 undergraduate majors, 150 masters students, and 100 PhD students. We are also proud of our connections to the community and region, with research and outreach programs serving the City of Chicago, local public schools, transportation systems, and more. Welcome message from Bob Sloan, Department Head The Computer Science Department offers three degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (including concentrations in Computer Systems and Software Engineering), the Master of Science in Computer Science, and the Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science. Our academic programs are designed to prepare students for successful careers in a rapidly evolving discipline, and we place a strong emphasis on design principles and practice. Computer Science remains an outstanding major for these difficult times. Our graduates continue to find excellent jobs, and equally important, Computer Science empowers you to do good: to connect technology to your world. We are a department both old and new. The University of Illinois at Chicago was founded in 1965, and as Computer Science grew as a field, Computer Science faculty were housed in the Department of Information Engineering, which in 1982 became the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In July 2001, Computer Science became a department in its own right.   Department of Computer Science  851 S.

The diversity of the members of our campus community will be apparent and, moreover, UIC will be known as an institution of higher education where diversity is a cornerstone of intellectual achievement. As a truly diverse institution, UIC will engage citizens from all the communities of Chicago and all the many other communities that comprise the state which we serve. UIC is one of the most diverse campuses in the United States and a great place to study, learn, work, and prepare for the global interdependence of people and markets. The seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are a collaborative group that aims to make UIC a welcoming and inclusive place for all students, faculty and staff. The Centers are committed to student success, intercultural engagement, vibrant scholarship, and dynamic community partnerships. While the presence of numerically diverse students, faculty, and staff can be critical to challenging assumptions about the status quo and to providing fresh approaches that can help to invigorate\u2014and democratize\u2014the academy, representational diversity is not an airborne virus whose mere presence spreads the beneficial outcomes of diversity. Representational diversity is a resource that must be intelligently and intentionally drawn on to be appreciated and ultimately produce positive outcomes. Representational diversity is but the first step in a spectrum of intentional efforts designed to maximize the benefits of diversity by incorporating it in our living, teaching, learning, research and public service.\r\n\r\nGoal 6 calls for systemic change to the ways we regard and reward diversity work by faculty and students and the way in which we assess academic programs. We expect students to learn more about diversity, and faculty and staff will have opportunities, methods, and resources for developing diversity competencies. New vehicles for communicating about diversity will be offered as will resources for encouraging collaboration among researchers and practitioners of diversity. Many are attracted to UIC by its diversity, but simple exposure to difference cannot transform our campus into a thriving community that values difference. Everyone at UIC must consciously and deliberately work to create an environment that welcomes varied identities if we are to create a community distinguished by principles and practices of diversity, equity, and social justice. Goal 3 focuses on our interactions with, and understandings of each other, both of which are needed if we are to fully appreciate the contributions of others. The ultimate goal of creating a climate of diversity and equity is not to make everybody feel good about themselves. Rather, the goal is to build a culture in which individuals are poised for the pursuit of excellence and offered many and varied opportunities to achieve it.\r\n\r\nWe must begin by knowing our campus climate as it truly is. UIC will assess the climate experienced by its staff, students, and faculty by means of a periodically reiterated survey. When we identify shortcomings, we will design solutions. Climate surveys will make a special point of considering accessibility issues that impact equal participation in and enjoyment of campus life by all individuals, including those with disabilities. UIC will strive to implement principles of universal design in physical planning of space and facilities.  Foundational to the UIC Strategic Plan are core values identified as \u201cso essential to UIC that they inform every element of individual and institutional practice.\u201d  They include: Knowledge, Openness, Access, Excellence, Collaboration and Caring. With these values as foundational to our institutional culture, we further state our commitment to diversity, which must extend beyond policies and statements, to ensure our campus climate is such that all our community members feel welcomed and valued. The values articulated below and in the diversity strategic thinking report, Through the Lens of Diversity, emerged from UIC\u2019s diversity strategic planning initiative as essential to a truly diverse university. Our values must be infused in every aspect of the work of the university. \nthe content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n\nEnvelope icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join Our Mailing List \n\nPhone icon\n\n\n\n\n\n Like Us On Facebook \n\nDocument icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read What's On Our Bookshelf \n\nUser icon\n\n\n\n\n\n Photos \n  A Mosaic for UIC Transformation\n   \n  Mission Statement\n    Diversity Strategic Plan Frida Sanchez | Diversity Communications | Posted on September 19, 2018 Diversity Communications, Luisa J.

At one end of the spectrum, computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation.  At the other end of the spectrum, computer science may be seen as the application of human resources, software and of course, computers to solve computational problems relating to society's and individuals' needs. A well-trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum--and several points in between.  The Computer Science curriculum in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background.  Along with a strong theoretical component, our program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design, implementation and validation of computer systems.  In our experience, industry and graduate programs alike value--above all--people who can solve real problems, and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade. All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science: computer systems, organization and architecture, algorithms and data structures, principles of software design, elements of the theory of computation, and operating systems.  In addition, students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in Computer Science.  Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics, along with additional courses in writing, humanities, social sciences and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers. There are very few areas in modern society untouched by Computer Science.  Computer science is present in everything from health care, telecommunications and entertainment, to transportation, education and defense. The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field.  In support of this, the Computer Science program provides its students with a well-rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science, placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills. Student Affairs Calendar Undergraduate Admissions  Student Graduation Objectives Frequently Asked Questions The Computer Systems Concentration represents a sub-specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware.  The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science: programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture and operating systems.  Unlike traditional computer science, however, the student also studies low-level circuit analysis and high-level system design, and has the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses.  The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering. The Software Engineering Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science, including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems.  In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of software engineering practice such as software cost estimation, large-scale software development, and risk management. The Human-Centered Computing Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in areas such as: user-interface design and development for desktop or mobile devices; computer graphics and animation for video games, movie special effects; and scientific-, engineering- and medical visualization.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems.

Further, federal regulations require institutions of higher education to disclose information for filing complaints. The information below is intended to provide both institutional and external contact information to current and prospective students. Academic Concerns Students are encouraged to contact their college office to seek advice. The Student Handbook, the undergraduate catalog, and the graduate catalog provide guidance on campus-level policy. If complaints cannot be resolved at the college level or with the help of Student Ombuds Service (see below), the formal mechanism to register student complaints is through the Student Academic Grievance Procedures. They define an administrative process through which students may seek resolution of complaints or grievances regarding academic standing during their enrollment at UIC. Examples of complaints addressed by this process include but are not limited to grade disputes and program dismissals. Note that these procedures may not be used for decisions made as a result of the Student Conduct Process, described below. Other Complaints If a complaint cannot be resolved within the college or the student prefers to speak to someone outside of the college, students have access to several services within the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS). The Student Ombuds Service within the Office of the Dean of Students provides an impartial advocate for fairness who investigates student complaints. The Ombudsperson may serve as a counselor, go-between, mediator, or informal fact finder. Some of the matters which may be addressed by this service include grade disputes / grievance procedures, student record errors, billing / financial issues and registration problems. The Student Conduct Process within the Office of the Dean of Students is also available to any student, university employee, or community member with a complaint about a UIC student. They can file a student misconduct incident report or academic integrity incident report form regarding possible violations of the University Standards of Conduct, which is included in the Student Disciplinary Policy. The Office for Access and Equity strives to increase access to employment, programs, and services in an environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. As part of the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) is the office charged with reviewing and addressing complaints of harassment and/or discrimination. This includes sex discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and retaliation. Students may file a complaint internally using the established reporting process on the OAE website. UIC is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, services, and all activities at UIC. Students with complaints or concerns about accessibility issues on campus can submit an Online Report of UIC Accessibility Issues available at the UIC Disability Resources website. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) receives these reports and follows up with different units on campus based on the nature of the complaint. If the student experiences discrimination based on disability it should be reported directly to the Office of Access and Equity (OAE). External Resources If a student's complaint cannot be resolved by the University, a complaint may be filed with the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which regulates higher education institutions in Illinois, through their Complaint System; or the student may contact the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), UIC's regional accrediting agency, through their Complaint Process. Online Education Complaint Resolution Students enrolled in Online or Distance Education courses are encouraged to contact their respective college office to seek advice. Since the University of Illinois at Chicago has been approved as an institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) initiative by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA), students enrolled from participating SARA states, as indicated by the State Authorization webpage, follow the SARA Complaint Resolution Process. Such students may contact the Illinois Board of Higher Education (the Illinois SARA portal agency) with complaints that were not resolved through the student campus complaint procedures described above by accessing the IBHE online complaint system. Students enrolled in programs in states outside of SARA contact their own state agencies with complaints that were not resolved through the student UIC campus complaint procedures described above. Online students with questions about complaint procedures may also contact UIC Extended Campus at onlineinfo@uic.edu or at (312) 355-0423.

Graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., CS 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Check your registration to ensure you meet the restrictions on registration of CS classes. The Master of Science program is designed for students who have received their undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and wish to develop greater depth and/or breadth in computer science. The MS degree prepares students for more challenging\u2013and often more highly-compensated\u2013work in their professional careers. UIC Computer Science MS alumni have traditionally been well-positioned for interesting and rewarding careers. MS degree could be completed with a Coursework, Project or Thesis Option. Full-time, well-prepared, highly motivated students may complete the program in as few as three semesters; most students complete the program in four to six semesters of residence. Detailed MS degree requirements are published below: The Doctor of Philosophy program is designed for students who have received their MS degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and who wish to develop greater depth and breadth in computer science, with particular emphasis on the development of expertise in Computer Science research. The PhD degree prepares students for the most challenging\u2013and often most highly-compensated\u2013work in the field of Computer Science. Typically, PhD graduates are employed in commercial or industrial research, or themselves become faculty members in Computer Science departments throughout the world. Exceptional applicants who have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, or a related field, and wish to pursue a PhD will be considered for a \u201cDirect PhD Admission\u201d. Such students will pursue the PhD degree without the requirement or option of first completing a Master degree. Detailed PhD degree requirements are published below: Financial Aid Information Department financial aid is available in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships and tuition fee waivers. Students on good standing as defined by the department standards can be nominated and/or awarded any type of aid. \u00a0 Fellowships Various fellowships are available through the Graduate College and outside foundations. \u00a0Students and faculty are notified periodically of these fellowships and deadlines.\u00a0 Fellowships available through outside foundations may require students to be Permanent Residents or citizens of the US. \u00a0Consult the \u2018Funding your Education\u2019 section of the graduate college website (http://grad.uic.edu/funding-your-education) for awards available through the graduate college and general information on the fellowships and funding.. Fellowships available through the Graduate College are awarded in recognition of scholarly achievement and promise. \u00a0They enable students to pursue graduate studies and research without a service requirement.\u00a0 The stipends vary by fellowships and unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fellows supported by the Graduate College (i.e., University Fellowships, Dean\u2019s Scholar, Abraham Lincoln, DFI (formerly IMGIP/ICEOP) carry a tuition and fee waiver. (Check with your home department for details). \u00a0Some fellowships allow recipients to accept additional funding, recipients should consult the terms of the award for details. Dean\u2019s Scholar Award and Chancellor\u2019s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program are the two most prestigious awards provided by the Graduate College. \u00a0These are described on the Graduate College website as follows: Dean\u2019s Scholar Award: The Dean\u2019s Scholar Award is a one-year, non-renewable award presented by the Dean of the Graduate College in recognition of a student\u2019s scholarly achievement. It is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs. \u00a0The Dean\u2019s Scholar competition is open to doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College required Preliminary Examination at the University of Illinois at Chicago and are well into their dissertation work. \u00a0 Application Procedures: \u00a0Deadlines for UIC fellowships and other awards administered through the Graduate College are established jointly by the Awards Committee of the Graduate College and the Graduate College. \u00a0Since departments need to submit nominations to the Graduate College (wherever it states \u201cdepartment nominations due\u201d), complete application is due to the CS Student Affairs office at least 5-7 days prior to the Graduate College deadline. \u00a0Recommendation letters should be in electronic format and submitted directly by the recommender to the CS Student Affairs office (grad@cs.uic.edu). Non UIC fellowships have their own submission rules. Students should contact the CS Student Affairs office for any questions upon announcement of the fellowships. Upon announcement of the deadlines for the fellowships offered by the graduate college, students interested in applying should talk to their advisor first and with consultation must submit an Application for Graduate Appointment, statement of purpose, resume with publications and three recommendation letters (one from advisor) to the CS Student Affairs Office. \u00a0The Director of Graduate Studies will select from among the applicants and submit nominations for consideration by the Graduate College Awards Committee, which makes the final recommendation to the Dean. Chancellor\u2019s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program: This program supports increased multidisciplinary scholarship opportunities and exposure to careers in research and creative fields for graduate and professional students. Successful applicants must show exceptional promise for future multidisciplinary research and creative activity in their fields of interest. \u00a0Funding will allow graduate or professional candidates to supplement existing stipends with a 0% fellowship appointment for the fellowship period. Applications will be evaluated not only on the quality of the prospective student, but also the quality of the proposed project and mentored experience. A faculty mentor will direct the project but it is expected that the student will play the major role in the writing of this application. \u00a0Consult the graduate college web site for details on the program and application procedure. \u00a0 \u00a0 Teaching Assistantships for Continuing Students Teaching Assistantships (TA\u2019s) are awarded to students with outstanding academic records. \u00a0TA\u2019s assist in the teaching and grading of CS course work under the direction of the course instructor. \u00a0The assistantship includes a monthly stipend and waiver of tuition and fees.\u00a0 Details of waiver are available at http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships, stipends for Computer Science students are higher than minimum specified. Amount: Current monthly stipend is approximately $2,084 ($2,145 for students who passed the PhD qualifier) and a tuition and fee waiver. The stipend is subject to change, all fees are not covered by the waiver. \u00a0 Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply. \u00a0Graduates of foreign institutions should have the Oral Certification from the ITA office.\u00a0 These are the minimum requirements for TA eligibility; many factors determine the offers of TA positions. \u00a0 Application Procedure: Decisions for the following academic year (fall and spring semesters) are made during the Summer. \u00a0Students must complete and submit the online application when it is open.\u00a0 Students are notified via UIC email when the application is open. \u00a0TA positions are generally assigned for the academic year (fall and spring); thus very few TA positions are available for the spring semesters. \u00a0Applications for Spring semester are available in December. Registration Requirement: At least 8 hours in Fall and Spring. Students are not required need to register in Summer, but must register for at least 3 hours to receive the tuition and service fee waiver. English Proficiency: Illinois State Law requires all international teaching assistants providing instruction in classroom, discussion group, laboratory, or office hour situations to be certified proficient in speaking and communicating in English. The CS Department requires ALL graduate students appointed as Graduate Teaching Assistants pass the Oral Certification administered by the International Teaching Assistant Program. \u00a0Graduate students who received their undergraduate degree in the United States or from a country in which the primary language is English are not required to receive the Certification. \u00a0Information on the ITA program can be obtained from \u00a0http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page /. \u00a0 \u00a0 Tuition and Fee Waiver A limited number of tuition and fee waivers are available to the department through Graduate College. These awards provide an exemption from tuition fee, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA and partial cost of \u00a0Campus Care health insurance (Fall & Spring only).\u00a0 Students must be registered for 12 hours of study during the entire semester in which they receive the waiver.\u00a0 A student who drops below the 12 hour requirement at any time in the semester will be responsible for all tuition and service fees. \u00a0 Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply. Application Procedure: Decisions for the Fall semester are made during the Summer. \u00a0Students must complete and submit the online completed application when it is open. \u00a0Students are contacted via UIC email when the application is open.\u00a0 Applications for the Spring semester are available in December. Registration Requirement: \u00a0At least 12 hours in Fall and Spring and 6 hours in Summer. \u00a0 Research Assistantships Students are encouraged to contact faculty members with shared research interests directly. The faculty member, depending on the availability of grant money determines the term and eligibility requirements of the appointment. CS Graduate Student Processes Course Selection All graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest. \u00a0PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition. \u00a0New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year. Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research. \u00a0Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester. \u00a0 Registration Restrictions* \u2013 CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS. \u00a0 How is it implemented? Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905). \u00a0We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs. *The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed. \u00a0 Other course processes Some 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation. \u00a0If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course. Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester. \u00a0See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships: http://grad.uic.edu/assistantships. \u00a0Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer. \u00a0Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees. The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework. \u00a0Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively. \u00a0 Course Prerequisites If your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses. \u00a0 Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing Courses Students should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms). \u00a0Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes. Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class. \u00a0Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review. As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS). \u00a0If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a \u201clate drop\u201d, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript. \u00a0A \u201cW\u201d cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade. The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: \u201cI have had this material before\u201d, \u201cThis course will not be useful to me\u201d, \u201cI am taking too many courses\u201d, \u201cI do not have the prerequisites\u201d, \u201cI forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline\u201d, \u201cA bad grade will affect my GPA negatively\u201d or \u201cI have not attended classes for the past few weeks\u201d. \u00a0It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites. Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply. Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students. \u00a0In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission. \u00a0 Good Academic Standing In addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (http://grad.uic.edu/continuing-student-status), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty. \u00a0 Grades Coursework earn grades of A, B, C, D or F; research hours a \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018U\u2019. \u00a0GPA is calculated based on the grades and credits hours.\u00a0 For details see: http://grad.uic.edu/grades. \u00a0 Probation and Academic Dismissal All graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 (B) grade point average (GPA). \u00a0The GPA calculation does not include independent study and research courses (CS 590, CS 595-599). Graduate course work must be satisfied by a C grade or higher. \u00a0If a student\u2019s graduate GPA falls below 3.0 (B), the Graduate College will issue a letter of warning and impose academic probation for a specified period of time. \u00a0Failure to comply with the terms will likely result in dismissal from the CS program and Graduate College.\u00a0 Details of this available at: http://grad.uic.edu/probation-and-academic-dismissal. A student on probation is ineligible for department awarded financial aid, recommendation for any type of practical training, or graduation. Instructional Computing Facilities The Computer Science Department maintains an instructional computing facility and remote servers, which serve its students\u2019 computing needs for CS coursework. \u00a0 Student Access: Each new student is assigned a CS account which expires one year after graduation. Your login may be checked at http://go.uic.edu/csaccount and passwords are initially set to the student\u2019s UIN. We highly encourage users to change their passwords after their initial login. * Students are given a space quota of 1 GB and print quota of 600 pages/semester. Accounts can be accessed by logging on to the lab workstations or remote servers, allowing students the flexibility to complete their course work from the lab, home or work. \u00a0 The facility consists of the following equipment: Department Workstations: * 52 Linux machines (CentOS7) * 1 printer * 4 LCD monitors for student collaboration Department Remote Servers: * bert.cs.uic.edu * ernie.cs.uic.edu * systems.cs.uic.edu \u00a0 CS Instructional Laboratory\u00a0 Location: 2nd floor of SEL (room 2254). Lab Hours: Monday \u2013 Thursday 8am \u2013 11pm | Friday 8am \u2013 9pm (During the Fall and Spring semesters) \u00a0 In case of problems or error, please contact the lab consultant on duty or email support@cs.uic.edu Department Computer Policy The University of Illinois at Chicago and the department of computer science are committed to providing an educational environment that is accessible to all students. In accordance with this commitment, students in need of accommodations due to a disability should contact the Disability Resource Center or Phone (312) 413-2183 for verification and determination of reasonable accommodations as soon as possible. Departmental Information for TAs Once a student has accepted a TA position, he/she must request any changes to their TA appointment at least two weeks prior to the start of classes. \u00a0Resigning the TAship at the last minute or after the semester begins; and unavailability for TA duties on the first day of classes is unacceptable and will negatively reflect future TA/TFW consideration. New international student TA\u2019s must pass the Oral Certification by the end of their 1st semester. \u00a0Information can be obtained from ITA website at http://grad.uic.edu/international-teaching-assistants-program-home-page. Once the TA assignment has been finalized, the TA should contact their instructor to introduce themselves, become familiar with the requirements of the course and instructor and understand the TA duties. \u00a0Whether you are working as an assistant in a lab or course or a grader it is essential that you contact the instructor prior to the start of classes. Helpful information and questions you should ask before classes begin: Course information TA Responsibilities \u201cIf there is a Problem\u201d What is the best way to reach the professor? \u00a0By email? Office number and phone? Home phone? When is the best time? General Information Academic Misconduct It is mandatory for all TA\u2019s to be present during TA orientation and ready for TA duties on the first day of classes. \u00a0TA\u2019s who will be away during the December break must make arrangements to arrive by these dates. Mailboxes Mailboxes are not provided to any CS graduate students. \u00a0If a class requires paper submission of assignments, TA should notify the CS Student Affairs for submission options. \u00a0The faculty and staff mailboxes are located in the Main office (1120 SEO).\u00a0 If you want to drop off something for a faculty or staff \u2013 visit the main office to locate the appropriate box. \u00a0No personal mail should be sent to the department address; the department will NOT be responsible for any lost mail. \u00a0 Offices We do our best to provide a TA office to all TAs but have limited space available. \u00a0If you intend to use your lab space for office hours \u2013 contact your advisor to verify this is acceptable and inform the CS Student Affairs Office of the office information. No personal items, food, refrigerator, toasters, coffee machines etc. should be stored in TA offices. This is a shared space designed to help you fulfill your TA duties. \u00a0The space must be kept clean and in good working order. It is your responsibility to ensure your students respect the office space. If you plan on graduating soon and would like to have a Graduation Check done, send an e-mail with your name and UIN to the Student Affairs Office.  MS and PhD graduation requirements are available in your respective Graduate Program Requirements Manual above. Read through Graduation Guidelines for the graduation process. Quick links to various graduations forms: Other General Information \u00a0 Curricular Practical Training is permission to work off-campus at an internship while you are enrolled at the University for International students. \u00a0CPT is handled through the College of Engineering\u2019s Engineering Career Center (http://ecc.uic.edu/). The Computer Science department does not allow any students who are not on good standing (GPA below 3.0) to participate in this program. \u00a0 The Computer Science department will allow you to go for optional practical training (OPT) and will give approval for such training at the conclusion of your degree. You must be on good and full standing to get approval for OPT. If you were admitted on limited standing and have not satisfied the requirements or your GPA is less than 3.0 (B), you will not be given approval for OPT until the requirements have been met. You must start this process very early; contact the Office of International Services (OIS) in SSB for the guidelines on the process. \u00a0The OPT authorization/approval required by OIS can be provided only by the staff in the CS Student Affairs Office.\u00a0 Approval from advisors is not acceptable. \u00a0 All new students who enroll at UIC are automatically enrolled in an insurance plan and the UIC student health care program consisting of two components \u2013CampusCare (http://campuscare.uic.edu/), a comprehensive student health insurance program to cover you for loss due to a covered injury or illness, and the UIC Department of Family Medicine, which provides you, via your health service fee, with coverage for routine care including physical examinations. For registered students, coverage is continuous, beginning with the first day of the term until the first day of the next term. Students have the option to waive the insurance coverage by completing a waiver form and presenting evidence of other comparable insurance coverage (copy of your insurance card). The waiver forms and deadlines are available on the CampusCare website. \u00a0Students who had previously waived the plan will remain waived, but may apply for the CampusCare insurance plan, subject to a determination of eligibility if they desire to be reinstated. Dependents (spouse and children) may be added to the coverage after filling out a Dependent Application, for an additional fee. \u00a0 Any changes to your name, address, telephone number or current address have to be reported to the UIC Records Office in SSB, the CS Student Affairs Office of Computer Science, Office of International Services (if you are on any kind of visa) and Human Resources (HR) (if you are working as TA/RA/GA at UIC). \u00a0Changes with records can be done through your my.UIC.edu account and for OIS report to your International services advisor directly.\u00a0 To report changes to the CS department you can e-mail Elena or Santhi.\u00a0 HR go to http://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/ to change your address so that the W2 for that year is mailed to the correct address. All requests for letters should be submitted via e-mail to the CS graduate email \u2018grad@cs.uic.edu\u2019 for the CS Student Affairs Office. \u00a0The request should include your name, UIN, degree and details of the information needed in the letter. Letters are usually processed and ready for pick up within 1-2 business days, an email will be sent when the letter is ready. \u00a0Walk-in requests are not accommodated.\u00a0 Below are the most common letters requested: You represent the department as you interact with the UIC community. \u00a0We expect all our students to conduct themselves in a courteous, respectful and professionalism manner. If you have a grievance related to a particular course please discuss it with the instructor first and see if the issue can be resolved. If you are not satisfied with the response from the instructor, stop by the CS Student Affairs Office or make an appointment to speak with the DGS (dgs@cs.uic.edu).
