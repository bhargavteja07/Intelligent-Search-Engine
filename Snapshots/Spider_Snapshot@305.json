The master of city design degree, based in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will offer an interdisciplinary learning experience that blends elements of architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and other creative fields. Students will experience intensive city-based courses and studios that provide immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice. \u201cThe master of city design expands the portfolio of degree offerings by the college, reflecting the changing needs of cities and metropolitan regions,\u201d said Michael Pagano, dean of the college. \u201cThat the degree is offered in the center of a global city makes it an exceptionally attractive program for professionals who are looking to enhance their skill set.\u201d Serving as director designate for the program is Sanjeev Vidyarthi, whose own training and professional experience combines architecture, urban design and spatial planning. Sanjeev Vidyarthi, UIC associate professor of urban planning and policy and director designate of the master of city design program. \u201cThe master of city design program not only showcases the university\u2019s Great Cities Commitment, but is also well-positioned to produce reflective designers equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills to face the complex challenges of an increasingly urban world,\u201d said Vidyarthi, associate professor of urban planning and policy. The program will prepare students for career opportunities at planning and design consulting firms and related work with governments, foundations, community organizations and public sector agencies. It will also enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design. Graduates of the program will be desirable to prospective employers for their \u201cability to conceive urban public spaces and civic improvement projects by focusing on the physical design aspects of spatial relationships and interactions between people and places,\u201d Vidyarthi said. The program\u2019s courses will be taught by faculty and urban scholars from UIC research centers such as the Great Cities Institute and Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, and accomplished practitioners from Chicago\u2019s leading design firms. The 38-credit-hour degree can be completed in one year of full-time study. Applications are due Feb. 15 for international applicants and March 15 for domestic applicants. To be considered for a limited number of departmental scholarships, applicants should apply by Jan. 15. In addition to the new degree, the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers two bachelor\u2019s degrees in urban studies and public policy, along with master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in urban planning and policy as well as public administration. Certificate programs in geospatial analysis and visualization, and public transit planning and management are also available.

Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity and seizures, affects more than 65 million people worldwide. About one-third have difficulty controlling their seizures even with medication. Seizures can interfere with work, relationships and the ability to live independently. Previous research has shown that living in neighborhoods with high rates of crime have significantly higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.\u00a0Stress is also a factor that is commonly reported to trigger seizures in people with epilepsy. The UIC study included 63 adults with epilepsy living within the city limits of Chicago who were participating in a larger study testing the efficacy of a tablet-based educational tool that provides tailored information about epilepsy. That study, called PAUSE, involves patients at the University of Illinois Hospital\u2019s epilepsy clinic and in the Chicagoland community and is facilitated by the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago. The researchers determined the levels of crime in neighborhoods of the 63 participants by mapping their ZIP codes to specific neighborhoods and then cross-referencing those neighborhoods with local crime rates available through the City of Chicago Police data portal. Participants self-reported the number of seizures they had in the past month and in the past three months. \u201cWe found that people living with epilepsy who live in high-crime neighborhoods experienced significantly more seizures,\u201d said Jessica Levy, a research coordinator in the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation who presented the findings. \u201cOn average, people in high-crime neighborhoods had three seizures versus one for people living in low-crime neighborhoods when we looked back over the last 30 days. Over the course of 90 days, people in high-crime neighborhoods had seven seizures on average compared to three for those living in low-crime neighborhoods, so the link between crime and seizure activity is significant.\u201d The researchers found no overall association between neighborhood crime status and the duration of epilepsy or between crime status and poverty. Having more seizures can significantly lower quality of life. Seizures that result in falls can cause bruising or even broken bones. There can also be a stigma associated with having a seizure in public. \u201cUnderstanding the impact of violence and crime as potential triggers for seizures underscores the need for further research that might allow clinicians to make better-informed recommendations for self-management education and stress management skills,\u201d said Dr. Dilip Pandey, associate professor of neurology and rehabilitation at UIC and an investigator on the study. Katharine Ozenberger is a co-investigator on the study. The PAUSE study is conducted through the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation by Dr. Dilip Pandey and Dr. Jeffery Loeb. PAUSE is supported by the University of Illinois Prevention Research Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network under CDC cooperative agreement no.
